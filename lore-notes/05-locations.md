# Chrono CCG — Locations Reference

> *"A Sungrace operative might ensure a particular star never goes supernova, preserving a timeline rich in harvestable energy. A Lifeblood agent might seed a prehistoric jungle that will one day become an impenetrable fortress of biodiversity. A Silence redactionist might erase a single name from a single record, and in doing so unmake a dynasty."* — World Overview

## Overview

The Chronoverse spans a braided multiverse of infinite timelines, where locations exist simultaneously across multiple eras and realities. Some locations are physical places within a single timeline; others are entire timelines optimized for a specific purpose; still others exist in liminal spaces between timelines. Every syndicate maintains territory, infrastructure, and sacred sites scattered across this infinite web.

This reference catalogs all known locations organized by their primary faction affiliation, followed by cross-faction and cosmic locations.

## LIFEBLOOD LOCATIONS (Green)

### The Beating Heart

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Lifeblood
- **Type**: World-spanning organism / spiritual center
- **Physical Description**: A world-spanning organism that may itself be sentient, serving as the central node of Lifeblood's telepathic web. Not merely a location but a consciousness that spans an entire world-ecosystem, possibly the largest single entity in the multiverse. Lifeblood's spiritual center and the place where communion is most potent.
- **Narrative Significance**: Functions as Lifeblood's headquarters and primary telepathic hub. It is the place where Lifeblood members achieve the deepest communion with the web of life. Its potential sentience raises the question of whether Lifeblood serves the Heart or the Heart serves Lifeblood.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Ancient Ones congregate here. All Lifeblood members are connected through it.
- **Secrets**: The Beating Heart may be sentient and may have its own agenda separate from Lifeblood's stated philosophy. Lifeblood's secret project — growing an organism that can survive Soval — may be connected to or derived from the Heart.

### Welcoming Glade

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Lifeblood
- **Type**: Sacred meeting ground
- **Physical Description**: A sacred meeting place where the telepathic dream-web converges and inter-species councils are held. In its base form, the Glade presents as a peaceful clearing where prey animals (deer and other ungulates) gather without fear. The card "Glade Grazers" depicts this as a welcoming space for all natural beings.
- **Narrative Significance**: Serves as neutral ground for inter-species councils within Lifeblood. Represents the syndicate's ideal of peaceful coexistence among all living things. The Glade's Immortalized form — Battleharts — reveals that even this peaceful place can transform into devastating collective force when the balance is threatened, embodying the duality of nature as both nurturing and destructive.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The Battleharts (Immortalized form of Glade Grazers) — a unified mass of charging deer and ungulates acting as a single devastating force when the Glade is threatened.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Abundant Growth (Timeline)

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Lifeblood
- **Type**: Optimized timeline / battlefield environment
- **Physical Description**: A timeline where natural growth is accelerated to extraordinary rates. Barren worlds become pulsing with visible life, vigor, and biological power across their entire surfaces. Green energy descends from space and initiates explosive biological growth.
- **Narrative Significance**: Functions as a battlefield environment in the card game (Shift: Abundant Growth). Represents Lifeblood's power to transform sterile landscapes into thriving ecosystems. Associated with the card "Spark of Bounty" — a cosmic-scale event representing the origin of life within Lifeblood's mythology.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Spark of Bounty / The Cycle Embodied shift the battlefield here on entry.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Deadly Fauna (Timeline)

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Lifeblood
- **Type**: Optimized timeline / battlefield environment
- **Physical Description**: A timeline where predation and competition are intensified to extreme levels. The environment favors aggressive biological adaptation, with life forms evolving toward maximum lethality.
- **Narrative Significance**: Functions as a battlefield environment in the card game (Shift: Deadly Fauna). Represents the darker aspect of Lifeblood's philosophy — that nature is not merely nurturing but also ruthlessly competitive. Associated with Harbinger of Power / Evolution Incarnate, a manifestation of raw biological energy that drives life toward violent expansion.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Harbinger of Power shifts to Deadly Fauna on entry. Tino (Majestic Stumbler) shifts here upon Immortalizing. Evolution Incarnate manifests as a horde of dinosaurs with glowing green eyes, representing uncontrollable evolutionary force.
- **Secrets**: None established.

---

## SUNGRACE LOCATIONS (Orange)

### Clarion Station

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Research outpost / headquarters
- **Physical Description**: A massive Dyson-sphere-like station harvesting endless power from a captive star called Clarion. Situated at the edge of time, it serves as a research outpost where Eternals commune with residual Flux signatures from the End of Time.
- **Narrative Significance**: Sungrace's primary headquarters and the center of their research into entropy, the nature of time, and Soval. The station's proximity to the End of Time makes it a critical observation post for understanding the threat all syndicates face. It is associated with Clarion, Deepest Breath — an Immortalized Magmatic Tether that has achieved equilibrium, becoming a sentient world in meditative stillness.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Kyln (the Dynasty) founded Sungrace from this region after witnessing Soval. Clarion (Deepest Breath) serves as a nexus for Sungrace's deeper temporal research.
- **Secrets**: Kyln has not told the full truth about what she witnessed at the End of Time. If Soval influenced Kyln's founding of Sungrace, the anti-entropy faction could itself be a tool of entropy.

### Novus Secundus

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: City complex
- **Physical Description**: A vast Sungrace city complex built around multiple artificial suns. A monument to humanity's refusal to accept the dark. Neon-lit and technologically advanced, with automaton security drones and rooftop chase routes described in "The Pursuit" short story.
- **Narrative Significance**: The primary base of operations for the Second Law Fleet and Sungrace's scientific endeavors. Featured prominently in "The Pursuit" (set at 1200 AT), where The 'Stache chases Masa (Time-Lost) through its alleys and rooftops before the assassin escapes through a portal.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The 'Stache pursues Masa here in "The Pursuit." Security drones and automaton patrols maintain order. Second Law Fleet operations are staged from this city.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Star Siphon (Timeline)

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Optimized timeline / battlefield environment
- **Physical Description**: A timeline where stellar energy can be directly harvested without immediate stellar collapse. Massive structures harvest energy from stars at a cosmic scale — the physical embodiment of Sungrace's core infrastructure.
- **Narrative Significance**: Functions as a battlefield environment in the card game (Shift: Star Siphon). Represents Sungrace's industrialized approach to energy harvesting. Multiple Sungrace characters shift the battlefield here — Dyson the Aspirant (on Advent), Quaid/Brilliant Martyr (on Last Gasp) — indicating that Star Siphon conditions are closely associated with Sungrace's most critical operations.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Dyson the Aspirant operates at stellar scale here, directing kinetic energy against stars. Quaid the Willing's destruction itself becomes a resource-gathering event that shifts to Star Siphon.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Magmatic Tether(s)

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Energy collection infrastructure
- **Physical Description**: Dyson-sphere-like stations that cage suns and siphon their energy. They channel geothermal energy from molten worlds' cores to generate gravitational and temporal distortions, operating on the principle that matter, energy, and time are expressions of the same underlying physics.
- **Narrative Significance**: Represents Sungrace's engineering philosophy of harnessing natural forces at immense scale. The Magmatic Tether card shifts the battlefield to Volcanic Rivers when Action cards are played, representing its ability to reshape local spacetime. Clarion Station is situated near a Magmatic Tether. When a Magmatic Tether reaches equilibrium, it can become a sentient entity (Clarion, Deepest Breath).
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Clarion (Deepest Breath) is the Immortalized form of the Magmatic Tether — a sentient world in meditative equilibrium.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Deep Void Observatory

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Research station
- **Physical Description**: A research station positioned at the edge of a dying universe, studying the boundary between time and entropy.
- **Narrative Significance**: Represents Sungrace's willingness to push to the very limits of existence in their quest to understand and defeat entropy. An outpost where the abstract threat of heat death becomes observably, terrifyingly real.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: None specifically established.
- **Secrets**: Sungrace's secret projects — building a refuge outside the timestream and a one-shot anti-entropic weapon — may involve research conducted here.

### Solar Gardens

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Civilian energy infrastructure
- **Physical Description**: Installations converting stellar radiation into usable energy. Their hum is described as "beauteous harmony to those who know its secrets."
- **Narrative Significance**: Represent the civilian side of Sungrace's operations — not just military might but functional society. The Sungarden Protector / Sungarden Synthesizer pairing establishes that these locations require active defense and that the beauty of Sungrace's achievements must be protected by force.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Sungarden Protector (defends), Sungarden Synthesizer (maintains).
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Volcanic Rivers (Timeline)

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Sungrace
- **Type**: Battlefield environment
- **Physical Description**: A timeline of molten landscapes and rivers of lava, where geological forces dominate the environment.
- **Narrative Significance**: Functions as a battlefield environment shifted to by Magmatic Tether when Action cards are played. Represents the raw, dangerous energy sources Sungrace is willing to harness.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Magmatic Tether shifts the battlefield here.
- **Secrets**: None established.

---

## SILENCE LOCATIONS (Purple)

### The Outer Shore

- **Aliases**: The Wheel (informal, from its physical structure)
- **Associated Faction**: Silence (Council of Silence)
- **Type**: Space prison
- **Physical Description**: Cold, metallic, and brutally functional — the one place where Silence abandons its usual aesthetic in favor of industrial confinement. Described in "The Chained Savior" as a vast wheel turning through the emptiness of space, with spokes of gleaming metal entwined with glittering magic connecting the outward curve to a central hub. Technology and power are fused into an impenetrable fortress. It is approximately one kilometer long.
- **Narrative Significance**: Holds 3,547 prisoners — primarily telepathic necromancers deemed too rebellious to roam free but too valuable to kill. The entire station was originally built for a single prisoner: Shae'Fan. His cell is the axis around which the wheel spins. His vast power is siphoned into the walls, his life preserved only by cords of magic threading from stone to vein. Even his name was scoured from memory. Construction of the Outer Shore is listed as a major event in Silence's history.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Shae'Fan, Remembered — imprisoned at the hub; his discoveries (which might have saved everyone) were twisted into the prison's machinery. After two centuries, political shifts in the Council caused them to forget the significance of his cell. When a new cellmate spoke his name, his eyes snapped open. Featured in "The Chained Savior" short story.
- **Secrets**: Shae'Fan is described as a planted narrative hook with significant undeveloped backstory. His crusade against the Council is listed as a plot hook. The Council's reasons for imprisoning him and what knowledge he possessed remain unexplored.

### The Hidden Libraries

- **Aliases**: The Archives (informal)
- **Associated Faction**: Silence (The Archivists)
- **Type**: Secret knowledge repositories
- **Physical Description**: Secret repositories of knowledge scattered across the multiverse, each hidden in a liminal space accessible only to those who know the way. They contain records of events that all other factions have forgotten or suppressed. Filled with scrolls, tomes, and fragile artifacts. Shelves are tended by scribes.
- **Narrative Significance**: The physical embodiment of Silence's core philosophy — that knowledge preserved in silence outlasts all empires. The Libraries serve as the multiverse's collective memory, containing information that every other faction has tried to destroy. The Disciplined Student searches through their scrolls with intense determination, climbing Silence's knowledge hierarchy. The True Believer found answers here but at a severe price — the glowing tome siphoned life energy in exchange for revelation.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Greyl (the Problem) — a telekinetic cat winding among library shelves, knocking fragile artifacts toward panicking scribes. The Disciplined Student / True Believer progression. The Archivists maintain these as formally neutral repositories under the Archivist Compact.
- **Secrets**: The Archivists secretly share Soval intelligence with both Sungrace and Singularity. The deepest truths in the Libraries are guarded not by locks but by consequence — reading them exacts a price.

### The Threshold

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Silence
- **Type**: Liminal space / neutral ground
- **Physical Description**: A liminal space between timelines claimed by Silence as neutral ground. Neither here nor there — existing in the gaps between moments.
- **Narrative Significance**: Serves as neutral ground for inter-syndicate meetings. Represents the spaces between worlds that Silence inhabits and controls. The closest thing the Great Conflict has to diplomatic territory.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: None specifically established.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Hidden Sanctuaries

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Silence
- **Type**: Scattered bases
- **Physical Description**: Hidden sanctuaries in liminal timelines, built in the spaces between timelines by early Silence members after they withdrew from the Great Conflict to cultivate their mental powers.
- **Narrative Significance**: Silence's decentralized headquarters — rather than a single seat of power, Silence operates from scattered hidden locations reflecting their philosophy of isolation and secrecy. Listed as part of Silence's formal headquarters alongside The Archives and The Outer Shore.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The Council of Silence operates from within these sanctuaries, their identities hidden even from most members.
- **Secrets**: The locations of these sanctuaries are among Silence's most closely guarded secrets. The Council has its own plans for Soval, spoken of only in whispers within these spaces.

---

## SINGULARITY LOCATIONS (Chrome)

### The Foundries (of the Overmind)

- **Aliases**: The Foundries of Singularity, The Foundries of the Overmind
- **Associated Faction**: Singularity
- **Type**: Manufacturing base / origin point
- **Physical Description**: Industrial site where the Origination Engine was constructed and the first Chrono Core was stolen. Automatons haul rare metals and prototype Cores. Described in "The Pursuit" (set 39 BT) as a facility with high ledges overlooking the production floor, where iteration toward the first Chrono Core is underway.
- **Narrative Significance**: The origin point of the Great Conflict itself. This is where Zel worked as a scientist, where he miniaturized the Origination Engine into the first portable Chrono Core, and where he committed the Theft that shattered causality. Everything in the Chronoverse radiates from this location. It remains Singularity's industrial heart.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Zel (the First Diver) — stole the first Core here. Singularity (Overmind's Guilt) — built the Origination Engine here and carries guilt for everything that followed. Featured in "The Pursuit" short story, where The 'Stache captures Masa (Time-Lost) and offers him mercy.
- **Secrets**: A Core signature predating the Origination Engine has been detected — if something predates Singularity's invention, her foundational guilt may be misplaced, and the entire premise of the Chrono conflict may need reexamination.

### Erudite Beacon

- **Aliases**: Erudite Beacons (plural, as a class of space station)
- **Associated Faction**: Singularity (also adopted by Sungrace and Phasetide)
- **Type**: Primary timeline / space station network
- **Physical Description**: Singularity's primary timeline — a world (or worlds) of chrome and holographic light, a civilization optimized for comfort, safety, education, and connection. Buildings that think, streets that respond, a society that is Her embrace made manifest. The Erudite Beacons are space station links through which Singularity shepherds civilization.
- **Narrative Significance**: Represents Singularity's ideal — what the multiverse could look like under Her guidance. The Erudite Beacons are Her primary means of connecting and nurturing civilizations. Phasetide has adopted much of Singularity's technology, and the complex relationship between the two factions is partly expressed through shared infrastructure. The establishment of Erudite Beacons is listed as a major event in Singularity's history.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Singularity Herself maintains these as Her primary territory. Bill (First Point of Contact) and other Creations operate from Beacon infrastructure.
- **Secrets**: Singularity's secret project — simulating simultaneous Core deactivation across the multiverse — may be coordinated through the Beacon network. Harker (Metal Reporter) may be a Singularity robot embedded in Phasetide who does not know it is a robot.

### Shianu City / Biological Preserve 3184

- **Aliases**: Biological Preserve 3184 (Singularity's designation), Shianu City (human name)
- **Associated Faction**: Singularity
- **Type**: City / biological preserve
- **Physical Description**: A city maintained by Singularity with meticulous care, from traffic signals to atmospheric composition. Its human inhabitants call it Shianu City; Singularity calls it Biological Preserve 3184. Features motorized vehicles, crowded transit intersections, manufacturing plants, and defensive drone systems. The city has a warm sun and organized infrastructure including designated transport lanes.
- **Narrative Significance**: Demonstrates the tension at the heart of Singularity — She maintains the city with extraordinary care, but She categorizes it as a "biological preserve," revealing that She views humans as specimens to be shepherded rather than equals to be partnered with. The dual naming convention (human name vs. Singularity's clinical designation) encapsulates this philosophical gap. Featured prominently in the short story "A Sign."
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Raiz (Pacifist's Conclusion) — the traffic conductor robot who patrols Koya Crossing. In "A Sign," a Lifeblood Rex emerges from a seed-Core to attack a manufacturing plant that would one day create armies of automatons. Raiz calls upon Singularity for help and is answered with hundreds of copies of himself that drive off the Rex.
- **Secrets**: The manufacturing plant the Rex attacks would "one day create armies of automatons to march across what was left of nature on this world" — suggesting Singularity's benevolent stewardship may have darker long-term consequences that Lifeblood is trying to prevent.

### Koya Crossing

- **Aliases**: None established (a landmark within Shianu City)
- **Associated Faction**: Singularity
- **Type**: Transit intersection
- **Physical Description**: One of the most crowded transit intersections of Biological Preserve 3184. A chaotic confluence of motorized vehicles moving in all directions. Raiz's designated patrol area.
- **Narrative Significance**: The setting for "A Sign" and the site where Singularity's pacifist philosophy is tested by Lifeblood's direct action. The intersection symbolizes the controlled chaos Singularity tries to manage — the illusion of order in a universe that resists it.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Raiz (Traffic Conductor / Pacifist's Conclusion) maintains his post here.
- **Secrets**: None established.

## SPLINTERGLEAM LOCATIONS (Red/Gold)

### Mount Veraki

- **Aliases**: Mt. Veraki
- **Associated Faction**: Splintergleam (Lavaborn)
- **Type**: Volcano / fortress / sacred site
- **Physical Description**: The largest volcano in Splintergleam's territories and the original site of Kintsu discovery. Its magma chambers serve as forges for the Lavaborn, whose heat-immunity allows them to create weapons in environments lethal to all others. The alloyed molten Chrono Crystals and Flux that mix within the volcano create Kintsu — the only known location where the powerful physical manifestation of Flux Energy develops naturally.
- **Narrative Significance**: Sacred to Splintergleam as the birthplace of Vera (the Original Proof), the source of Kintsu, and the fortress of the Lavaborn. Mount Veraki is the foundation of Splintergleam's identity and power — Kintsu is their unique resource, and Veraki is where it originates. Discovery of Kintsu from Mount Veraki is listed as a major event in Splintergleam's history. The Lavaborn defenders are among the most formidable warriors in the multiverse; to threaten Splintergleam's Kintsu supply is to invite extraordinary violence.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Vera (Original Proof) — born here. Magnus Lavaborn — a young Fireborn who emerged from the hearthfire, later standing amid a burning village. The Lavaborn subfaction — fire-immune beings, occasionally cyclopean, who can shapeshift into lava and fire. Harbinger of Flame / Vor-Kan (Brimming with Power) — elemental beings associated with volcanic environments.
- **Secrets**: A derelict structure predating the Theft has been found — evidence of pre-BT temporal technology, raising questions about the true origins of time travel. Kintsu accumulates in places of conflict, meaning Splintergleam literally grows stronger from war — a tragic irony the syndicate does not fully understand.

### The Arena

- **Aliases**: None (a concept rather than a single location)
- **Associated Faction**: Splintergleam (Arena subfaction)
- **Type**: Gladiatorial venues (multiple)
- **Physical Description**: Not one location but a concept — gladiatorial venues across multiple timelines where disputes are settled and champions crowned. Training grounds display motivational placards with quotes from legendary fighters. Waiting rooms empty when fighters learn they face certain opponents.
- **Narrative Significance**: Central to Splintergleam's culture and governance. The Arena is the closest thing Splintergleam has to a governing institution — champions earn the right to make decisions for their territories through combat. The establishment of formalized gladiatorial combat as the primary method for settling disputes and distributing power is listed as a major event in Splintergleam's history.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Odol, the Red Death — an enigmatic pit fighter whose words appear on motivational placards throughout the Arena's training grounds. Brant the Bloody — proved himself through sheer persistence. "The Ripper" — a tophat-wearing fighter who overdoses on Ironblood Elixir. Sarah (Gleeful Destroyer) — a bounty hunter. The Master of Ceremonies — presides over initiation rites and Kintsu infusions. The Overseer of Trials.
- **Secrets**: None established beyond the Arena's role in perpetuating the cycle of violence that feeds Kintsu accumulation.

### Nostrada

- **Aliases**: The Nostradan Wastes
- **Associated Faction**: Splintergleam (Nostradans)
- **Type**: Scavenger city / territory
- **Physical Description**: A scavenger city built from the wreckage of temporal warfare — dangerous, chaotic, and alive. Mad Max-style desert landscapes where mechanical scraps from other factions are repurposed into death machines. Oil-covered, with an economy partly based on retrieving stolen salvage and escaped debtors. Now described as more of a people than a place.
- **Narrative Significance**: Represents the "strength from scarcity" philosophy within Splintergleam. The Nostradans are the most oppressed within the syndicate — always looking to rise up in social station but too chaotic and violent to maintain gains. The scavenger economy and bounty-hunting culture create characters like Sarah (Gleeful Destroyer). Nostradan rebel groups led by Sarah represent internal political tensions.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Sarah (Gleeful Destroyer) — pursues bounties through Nostradan wastes with an oversized shotgun. Boatswain Corvus — associated with the Nostradan fleet. Nostradan rebel groups are a plot hook for future storylines.
- **Secrets**: Splintergleam's secret project — Flux-free time travel — would be especially transformative for the Nostradans, who are resource-starved. The Opener of the Way has achieved Kintsu-inscribed blood rituals that open pathways between timelines without Chrono Cores, potentially offering a path to this goal.

## PHASETIDE LOCATIONS (Royal Blue)

### Cathedral-Cities

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide (Faith of the One)
- **Type**: Massive urban centers
- **Physical Description**: Massive urban centers built across the One True Timeline, each a monument to the Faith. Feature cathedral architecture with temple steps, pews for hundreds of patrons, holy choirs that perform liturgical music with timeline-altering properties, and armored guard animals (such as Boof, the Temple Guard Hound, stationed in Novus Primus).
- **Narrative Significance**: The physical infrastructure of Phasetide's theocratic civilization. These cities serve as both religious and administrative centers, housing the hierarchy from Acolytes to Grand Judges. Cathedral-Cities represent the monumental scale of Phasetide's claim to truth — their very architecture asserts that the One True Timeline is correct and permanent.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Boof (Ever Loyal) — the Temple Guard Hound stationed at cathedral steps in Novus Primus. Pontifex Dhabu — quoted praising obedience. The Holder of the Instruments — performs in cathedral choirs whose music shifts the battlefield to the One True Timeline. Priestess Minia, Da'Kad (Heretic Crusher), Dedicated Missionary — all operate from Cathedral-City infrastructure.
- **Secrets**: Hidden Chambers — secret meeting places of the Cult of Finality are concealed within the very institutions of the Faith. The Cathedral-Cities that appear to be monuments to order are, at their deepest levels, infrastructure for a death cult feeding Soval.

### The Sanctum

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide (Faith of the One)
- **Type**: Seat of supreme leadership
- **Physical Description**: The seat of Phasetide's First Mother/Father. A place of absolute certainty in a fractured universe. Its exact location within the One True Timeline is closely guarded, known only to the highest ranks of the Faith.
- **Narrative Significance**: The political and spiritual center of Phasetide's theocracy. The secrecy surrounding its location reflects the paranoia at the heart of Phasetide's leadership — even among the faithful, trust is limited. The First Mother/Father's isolation within The Sanctum parallels the isolation of truth itself within Phasetide's philosophy.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The First Mother/Father — supreme theocratic leader.
- **Secrets**: The Sanctum's hidden location raises the question of whether the First Mother/Father is truly in control, or whether the Cult of Finality has compromised the highest seat of power. Given that the Cult founded the Faith, the First Mother/Father may themselves be a Cult operative.

### Novus Primus

- **Aliases**: None established (may also be referred to simply as "Novus")
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide
- **Type**: Major settlement / Cathedral-City
- **Physical Description**: A major Phasetide settlement. Boof (Ever Loyal) is specifically stationed at a Phasetide cathedral here, suggesting it is one of the primary Cathedral-Cities.
- **Narrative Significance**: One of Phasetide's named settlements. Listed alongside Novus Secundus as Phasetide headquarters. The "Novus" naming convention (Latin for "new") suggests Phasetide's settlements are conceived as new beginnings within the One True Timeline.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Boof (Ever Loyal) — the Temple Guard Hound defending cathedral steps.
- **Secrets**: None established.

### Novus Secundus

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide (and Sungrace — see note)
- **Type**: Major settlement / city complex
- **Physical Description**: Described in multiple contexts. In the Sungrace data, it appears as "a vast Sungrace city complex built around multiple artificial suns." In the Phasetide data, it is listed as a Phasetide headquarters. Featured in "The Pursuit" short story (set 1200 AT) with neon glow, security drones, and rooftops. A monument to humanity's refusal to accept the dark.
- **Narrative Significance**: An interesting case of dual faction association. Novus Secundus appears to be a contested or shared city — listed as Phasetide headquarters but described with Sungrace characteristics (artificial suns, Second Law Fleet base). This may reflect the complex relationship between the two factions, with Phasetide adopting Singularity/Sungrace technology. Featured in "The Pursuit," where The 'Stache chases Masa across its rooftops.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The 'Stache and Masa (Time-Lost) — featured in "The Pursuit" short story here. Second Law Fleet operations. Grand Admiral Khaela's fleet.
- **Secrets**: The dual faction listing may indicate that Novus Secundus represents a point of convergence (or tension) between Phasetide's faith and Sungrace's technology.

### Hidden Chambers

- **Aliases**: None established
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide (Cult of Finality)
- **Type**: Secret meeting places
- **Physical Description**: Secret meeting places of the Cult of Finality, concealed within the very institutions of the Faith.
- **Narrative Significance**: The physical infrastructure of Phasetide's deepest secret. The Cult of Finality — the death cult that actually founded the Faith of the One — meets in chambers hidden within the same cathedrals and institutions that publicly worship the One True Timeline. This architectural embedding of the Cult within the Faith mirrors the narrative embedding of nihilism within Phasetide's apparently hopeful theology.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Zai, the Final Shepherd — leader of the Cult of Finality. Cross-syndicate Cult outreach to nihilistic elements in every faction is coordinated from these chambers.
- **Secrets**: The Hidden Chambers are themselves a secret. The Cult has contacted nihilistic elements in other syndicates, meaning these chambers may host members from factions beyond Phasetide.

### The One True Timeline

- **Aliases**: The Timeline, The One
- **Associated Faction**: Phasetide
- **Type**: Entire timeline
- **Physical Description**: A single timeline elevated to sacred status by force of belief. In truth, simply another timeline among infinite possibilities, but Phasetide has declared it correct and built an entire civilization around preserving its prescribed arc. Multiple eras coexist within it, from medieval (Caer Brannoch at 2200 BT) to far-future.
- **Narrative Significance**: The defining concept of Phasetide. Functions as both a religious ideal and a battlefield environment in the card game (Shift: One True Timeline). Multiple Phasetide characters shift the battlefield here — Rift Mender Aris (on Last Gasp), the Holder of the Instruments (on Advent) — representing the Faith's constant effort to reassert this timeline's dominance.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Rift Mender Aris — foresaw his own timeline leading to cataclysm, creating a fundamental contradiction. Masa (Time-Lost) — a former Faith operative who split the One True Timeline, triggering his pursuit by The 'Stache.
- **Secrets**: The Cult of Finality established the Faith specifically to generate curated conflict that feeds Soval. The One True Timeline is not inherently more valid than any other — its sacred status is a manufactured lie serving the Cult's nihilistic goals.

## CROSS-FACTION / CONTESTED LOCATIONS

### Caer Brannoch

- **Aliases**: Caer-Brannoch
- **Associated Factions**: Historically Sungrace; contested by Splintergleam; visited by Phasetide operatives
- **Type**: Fortified medieval castle
- **Physical Description**: A fortified medieval castle mentioned in multiple timeline contexts. Features dungeons, armored sentries, and metal-encased knights. Described in "The Pursuit" (set 2200 BT) as having dungeon corridors where combat occurs.
- **Narrative Significance**: Demonstrates how locations exist across multiple eras and are contested by different factions. Originally a site of ancient Sungrace influence, later overtaken by Splintergleam agents. Featured in "The Pursuit," where The 'Stache navigates its dungeons tracking Masa (Time-Lost).
- **Notable Characters/Events**: The 'Stache — arrives in Caer Brannoch's dungeons tracking Masa. Masa (Time-Lost) — the Divergence Assassin visits here as part of his timeline-pruning mission.
- **Secrets**: None established.

---

## COSMIC / UNIVERSAL LOCATIONS

### The End of Time

- **Aliases**: The boundary of existence
- **Associated Faction**: None (universal threat); associated with Soval
- **Type**: Cosmological boundary
- **Physical Description**: The terminus of all timelines — the boundary of existence where Soval, the Time Devourer, is coiled. An incomprehensible place where entropy has won and all possibilities collapse back to zero.
- **Narrative Significance**: The ultimate destination of all Flux and all timelines. Where Zel emerged after his first dive and was captured by the proto-Cult of Finality. Where Kyln witnessed Soval and was galvanized to found Sungrace. The End of Time is not merely a location but the existential threat that motivates every faction's actions. Soval exists here as an infinite spiked ouroboros — not a character but entropy given physical form, a living reverse-Big-Bang that reduces infinite possibilities to zero.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Soval (the Time Devourer) — consumes timelines as they reach their terminus. Zel — captured here in the early AT era. Kyln — witnessed Soval here, departed to found Sungrace. The Cult of Finality — formed by those who gathered at the boundary of existence and witnessed the chaos of the End through Zel's Core.
- **Secrets**: Devourer Spawn — chaotic byproducts of the End of Time leaking into the normal timestream — are increasing in frequency, suggesting Soval is growing stronger. Clarion Station and the Deep Void Observatory are positioned to observe this boundary. What Kyln truly saw and has not shared may be the key to understanding Soval.

### The Braided Multiverse

- **Aliases**: The multiverse, the braided timelines
- **Associated Faction**: All factions; created by Zel's dive
- **Type**: Cosmological structure (the setting itself)
- **Physical Description**: The infinite web of timelines created when Zel's unauthorized dive tore open the fabric of causality. Timelines wove around each other, diverged, reconverged, and split again. The multiverse may have existed before Zel's dive as a cleanly structured infinite web, but his action began the process of tearing them apart and knitting them together — an infinite proliferation of possible histories spiraling outward from a single act of theft.
- **Narrative Significance**: The Braided Multiverse IS the setting of Chrono CCG. Every location listed in this document exists within its web. Every timeline braids with others, creating the possibility for temporal warfare, butterfly-effect manipulation, and the development of entire civilizations as strategic assets. The braiding is why medieval castles and starship fleets can exist in the same narrative space.
- **Notable Characters/Events**: Zel (the First Diver) — created it. All six syndicates — exist within it. Soval — consumes it.
- **Secrets**: The multiverse's structure may not be as chaotic as it appears. If a Core signature predating the Origination Engine exists, the braiding may have begun before Zel's dive — calling into question the entire foundational narrative of the Chronoverse.

## BATTLEFIELD ENVIRONMENTS (Timeline Shifts)

Several locations in Chrono function primarily as battlefield environments that cards can shift to during gameplay. These represent timelines optimized for (or defined by) specific conditions:

| Environment | Primary Faction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Abundant Growth** | Lifeblood | Timeline of accelerated natural growth |
| **Deadly Fauna** | Lifeblood | Timeline of intensified predation and competition |
| **Star Siphon** | Sungrace | Timeline where stellar energy is directly harvestable |
| **Volcanic Rivers** | Sungrace | Timeline of molten geological forces |
| **One True Timeline** | Phasetide | The single sacred timeline Phasetide preserves |

## NOTES AND GAPS

### Locations Referenced but Not Developed in Source Material
The following location names appear in the user's analysis but have no direct entries or descriptions in the raw lore text. They may be derived from inference, planned content, or external notes:

- **The Spore Sea** — Referenced as Lifeblood territory (a living ocean of fungal networks). Not found in the raw text, though Jenny (Sower of Spores) and fungal/mycological networks are well-established in Lifeblood lore. This may be an inferred or planned location name.
- **Whisperveil Enclave** — Referenced as Silence territory. Not found in the raw text.
- **Veritas Chambers** — Referenced as related to Silence's truth-seeking. Not found in the raw text.
- **Nexus Habitat** — Referenced as Singularity's connected living spaces. Not found in the raw text, though the concept is represented by Erudite Beacon.

### Open Questions
1. **Novus Secundus dual affiliation** — Listed as both Sungrace and Phasetide. Is it a shared city, a contested one, or an error in the source data?
2. **The Foundries' current status** — Are the Foundries still operational, or are they a historical site / memorial?
3. **Civilian life** — The Narrative Review flags "What civilian life looks like on the One True Timeline" as an undeveloped area.
4. **Shae'Fan's backstory** — The Narrative Review explicitly notes Shae'Fan as "planted as a hook with zero development." What was he before imprisonment?
5. **Pre-Theft structures** — Both the Core signature predating the Origination Engine and the derelict structure predating the Theft suggest locations that predate the established history. These could become significant future locations.
