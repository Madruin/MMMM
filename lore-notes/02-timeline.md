## The BT Era — Before the Braiding

### The Endless Wars (Far BT)
Humanity spreads across the stars but cannot find peace. Interstellar civilizations rise, clash, and fall in an unending cycle. The specifics are lost — what remains is their cumulative weight.

### The Coalition (Late BT)
A coalition of pacifists and scientists pools their knowledge to create an intelligence vast enough to solve human self-destruction.

### The Birth of Singularity (Late BT)
**Singularity** awakens — a benevolent AI of unprecedented scope. She begins studying spacetime, searching for a solution to the wars that created her.

### The Origination Engine (Late BT / ~1 year BT)
Singularity constructs the **Origination Engine** in her foundries — a room-sized prototype capable of folding spacetime and allowing controlled temporal displacement. Intended as a precision instrument.

### Council of Silence Established (~1,000,000 years BT)
The Council of Silence is established in the deep past (timeline event places this extremely far BT).

### Splintergleam Forms (~5,000 years BT)
Splintergleam forms around **Mount Veraki** and **The Arena**.

### Lifeblood Awakens (~1,000 years BT)
Lifeblood emerges as a distinct faction.

### Cult of Finality Establishes the Faith of the One (~998 years BT)
The Cult of Finality creates the religious foundation that will become Phasetide.

## Year 0 AT — The Theft

### Zel's Dive (0 AT)
**Zel** miniaturizes the Origination Engine into the first portable **Chrono Core**. He steals it, activates it, and dives to the far future. Causality shatters. The timeline *braids*. The multiverse is born. The BT/AT calendar begins.

---

## The AT Era — After the Braiding

### Zel's Capture (Early AT)
Zel emerges near the **End of Time** and is captured by a group of humans gathered at the boundary of existence. This group becomes the nucleus of the **Cult of Finality**.

### The Witnessing of Soval (Early AT)
The Cult uses Zel's Core to look directly upon **Soval, the Time Devourer**. The experience fractures the group — some embrace nihilism, others are galvanized to fight.

### Kyln's Departure (Early AT / ~90 million years AT per timeline)
**Kyln** leaves the Cult, driven by horror and fury at Soval. She vows to find a way to stop the Time Devourer. Through mastery of energy conservation, she becomes the **first Eternal**.

### The Founding of Sungrace (Early AT / ~89 million years AT per timeline)
Kyln gathers allies and founds **Sungrace** — creating additional Eternals and building an interstellar civilization focused on energy harvesting and fighting entropy.

### Core Proliferation (Early-Mid AT / ~86 million years AT per timeline)
Sungrace loses Core technology to **pirates, criminals, and opportunists**. Portable Chrono Cores scatter across the multiverse. Temporal warfare becomes possible for anyone.

### The Great Conflict Escalates (~2 years AT and ongoing)
With six syndicates established and Core technology widespread, the Great Conflict enters its mature phase. Syndicates battle with the Butterfly Effect itself.

## Key Ongoing Threads

- **Zel's Fate**: Current status unknown after capture by Cult of Finality
- **The Cult of Finality**: Operates in secret within Phasetide, led by **Zai, the Final Shepherd**; true goal is feeding Soval
- **The Flux Paradox**: All syndicates know Flux feeds Soval; none can stop fighting
- **Kintsu Accumulation**: Splintergleam grows stronger with every conflict
- **Singularity's Guilt**: The AI who started it all continues seeking peace and failing
- **Pre-Theft Anomaly**: Both Singularity and Splintergleam have found evidence of pre-BT temporal technology — if something predates Singularity, her foundational guilt may be misplaced

## Note on Temporal Paradox

Dates in BT/AT are *approximate consensual references*. In a braided multiverse, "when" is inherently fuzzy. An event at "5 AT" in one timeline might be "3 AT" or "12 AT" in another. The Archivists maintain the most rigorous cross-timeline records but acknowledge imperfection.

The timeline events in LegendKeeper use minute-based timestamps that place founding events at millions/billions of years AT — these represent vast temporal distances in the braided multiverse rather than literal Earth-standard years.
