## 1. CHRONO CORES AND DIVING

### The Origination Engine

The **Origination Engine** was a room-sized prototype built by Singularity in her foundries during the era of endless human conflict. It was the first device capable of folding spacetime upon itself, creating a stable aperture through which a specific location or individual could be reset to an earlier point.

Key facts about the Engine:

- It was a **research instrument**, a proof of concept that controlled temporal displacement was physically possible.
- It was designed for **careful, surgical interventions** in the timestream — small corrections applied with infinite precision to untangle human conflict.
- It required **massive amounts of energy** and could only be activated from within Singularity's foundries.
- It was, by design, **impossible to steal**. When it was refined into the Chrono Core, that changed.
- In-game, the Origination Engine card's effect — resetting all agents, emptying the Timeline Stack, and erasing all graveyards — mechanically represents the rewinding of time to a clean state. Its Immortalize condition requires an empty hand, symbolizing the total expenditure of resources its creation demanded.

### The First Chrono Core

**Zel**, a scientist working in Singularity's foundries, miniaturized the Origination Engine into the first portable **Chrono Core**: a handheld device powered by crystallized neutrino Flux, capable of opening a temporal aperture around its wielder and displacing them through time. Zel activated the Core and dove to the far future. He became the **First Diver**, and the multiverse was unlocked.

### How Chrono Cores Work

A Chrono Core operates by generating an intense, localized distortion in the temporal substrate — essentially **punching a hole in the fabric of causality** and threading the user through it. The process requires a power source: Chrono Crystals, the common crystallized form of Flux energy.

Cores take vastly different forms across the syndicates (living seed pods, blood rituals, collapsing star siphons), but the general activation sequence is:

1. **Flux Ignition**: The Chrono Crystal or energy within the Core is consumed, releasing a burst of neutrino Flux energy that destabilizes local spacetime.
2. **Aperture Formation**: The released energy folds spacetime into a navigable tunnel — a temporary bridge between the diver's origin point and their destination in the timestream.
3. **Transit**: The diver passes through the aperture. To an outside observer, they simply vanish. To the diver, the experience varies — some describe it as instantaneous, others as a sensation of falling through infinite color.
4. **Emergence**: The diver arrives at their destination. The aperture collapses behind them.
5. **Flux Dispersal**: The act of diving generates a massive burst of neutrino Flux — energy on the scale of a supernova, yet composed entirely of neutrinos that pass through ordinary matter without interaction. Civilians in the affected timeline notice nothing. Syndicate detection equipment registers it clearly.
6. **Contest**: Other syndicates detect the Flux release and typically send their own divers to harvest the newly generated Flux and contest any change to the timeline. As both teams of divers arrive, their Cores begin to recharge on the dispersed Flux energy, allowing them to call in reinforcements. (This is the diegetic basis for how card matches begin.)

### Diving

**Diving** is the act of using a Chrono Core to travel through time. It is the fundamental act that drives the Great Conflict — the mechanism by which syndicates project power across the multiverse.

A diver travels to a specific timeline at a specific point. The braided multiverse contains functionally infinite timelines, and navigation between them requires skill, experience, and often luck. Experienced divers develop an intuition for the temporal substrate, sensing the currents and eddies of causality.

**Risks of diving:**
- The temporal substrate is threaded with Flux currents, timeline boundaries, and occasionally the chaotic influence of Devourer Spawn or other cosmic kaiju.
- Inexperienced divers can emerge in the wrong timeline or the wrong era.
- Failing to account for planetary rotation, orbit, and land-height can leave divers stranded in space or buried under mountains.

### Syndicate Diving Methods

Each syndicate has developed its own unique approach to diving, reflecting their core philosophy:

| Syndicate | Core Variant | Diving Method |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Lifeblood** | **Seed-Cores** — organic devices cultivated over millennia | Grow organic apertures that open like flowers blooming across time. Seed-Cores hiss closed after use, resembling living plant structures. Biological processes power the temporal displacement. |
| **Sungrace** | **Star Siphons / far-future tech Cores** — precision-engineered, powered by stellar energy | Uses mathematical exactitude to calculate dive coordinates. Industrial-scale Cores overflow with the energy of suns. The most technologically advanced approach. |
| **Silence** | **Telepathic navigation** — mind-based diving | Employs telepathic navigation; their Myths sense the shape of timelines through extrasensory perception. No conventional instrumentation needed. |
| **Singularity** | **AI-optimized Cores** — chrome/digital integration | Optimizes dive calculations through Her vast distributed intelligence, achieving unmatched efficiency. Considered the most efficient Cores in existence. |
| **Splintergleam** | **Scavenged/Kintsu-infused Cores** — broken and rebuilt | Scavenges and repurposes Cores from other syndicates, often achieving surprising results through unorthodox modifications. Cores may be fueled by blood and Kintsu. |
| **Phasetide** | **Prescribed dive protocols** — faith-based, ritualistic | Follows protocols handed down through religious tradition, trusting in the Faith's accumulated wisdom. Coordinated dive operations function as a matter of religious practice. |

### The Flux Cost of Diving

Every dive generates Flux. This is not a side effect — it is an inescapable physical consequence of temporal displacement, as fundamental as the heat generated by friction. The more powerful the dive, the more Flux is produced. The more divers active across the multiverse, the greater the total Flux output.

All Flux, spent or unspent, harvested or wild, ultimately flows toward one destination: the End of Time, where Soval waits. **The Chrono Core was built to save humanity. Every activation brings the end of everything a little bit closer.**

## 2. FLUX AND CHRONO CRYSTALS

### What Is Flux?

> *"You cannot see it. You cannot feel it. But every time a diver tears through the fabric of time, a star's worth of energy screams past you at the speed of light, and you never know."* — Jala, Sungrace Architect

**Flux** — formally **Neutrino Flux** — is the energy released by every temporal displacement event. When a Chrono Core activates and a diver transits between points in time, the folding and unfolding of spacetime produces an enormous burst of neutrino radiation — energy on the scale of a stellar supernova.

Under ordinary circumstances, neutrinos are ghost particles. They pass through planets, stars, and entire civilizations without interacting with matter in any detectable way. A civilian standing at ground zero of a dive event would feel nothing, see nothing, measure nothing with conventional instruments.

But Flux carries with it an **imprint of temporal distortion** — a signature of the spacetime fold that created it. This signature makes it detectable to anyone with the right equipment or sensitivity, and more importantly, it makes it **harvestable**.

### Chrono Crystals

**Chrono Crystals** are the common, stable form of crystallized Flux energy. When neutrino Flux generated by temporal displacement events condenses under the right conditions, it precipitates into **luminous, faceted crystalline structures** that can store vast amounts of temporal energy in a portable, stable form.

Chrono Crystals serve as the **foundational resource** of the Great Conflict:
- They power Chrono Cores
- They fuel syndicate operations and infrastructure
- They sustain the ability of factions to project influence across the multiverse
- They are, in every meaningful sense, the **currency of the temporal war**

Every crystal contains within it the echo of a dive that fed Soval.

**Natural formation**: Chrono Crystals form naturally in areas of heavy temporal activity. Battlefields where dozens of dives have occurred in rapid succession often yield crystal deposits in the aftermath. Syndicate mining operations extract crystals from these sites, refining raw crystallized Flux into usable fuel.

**In-game economy**: Diegetically, the in-game premium currency represents Chrono Crystals — Flux energy harvested by the player's divers during matches, crystallized into a resource that can be spent.

### The Flux Economy: How Syndicates Harvest

Every syndicate harvests Flux differently, reflecting their philosophy and capabilities:

- **Sungrace** — Uses technological dominance: vast collection arrays positioned near stellar objects, precision instruments that detect and capture Flux across light-years. Their approach is industrialized and efficient, treating Flux as an engineering problem to be solved at scale. They operate industrial-scale crystal refineries, processing raw Flux into precisely calibrated fuel cells.

- **Singularity** — Optimizes harvesting through Her distributed intelligence, deploying collection networks that anticipate dive events before they occur. Her methods are the most efficient, but she is haunted by the knowledge that the system she is optimizing is the system she accidentally created. Crystal growth and harvesting are near-theoretical efficiency.

- **Phasetide** — Harvests at institutional scale through the Faith of the One's vast organizational infrastructure. Thousands of devoted Holders and Bearers perform coordinated dive operations that generate and capture Flux as a matter of religious practice — tithes of temporal energy offered to sustain the One True Timeline. Crystal harvesting is treated as a sacred practice, with rituals accompanying every extraction.

- **Silence** — Relies on telepathic perception to detect Flux signatures that instruments cannot. Council operatives can sense dive events across vast distances, arriving to harvest residual Flux from sites that other syndicates have already abandoned. The Archivists maintain detailed records of Flux patterns across the multiverse. Hidden crystal caches are maintained throughout the multiverse, carefully curated by the Council.

- **Lifeblood** — Absorbs Flux biologically. Their deep connection to the web of living energy that spans all timelines allows them to draw Flux through organic processes — trees that drink temporal radiation through their roots, creatures that metabolize neutrino energy alongside sunlight. Their harvesting is passive, distributed, and deeply entwined with the ecosystems they cultivate. Crystals form naturally within their ecosystems, integrated into biological processes.

- **Splintergleam** — Scavenges. They raid the harvesting operations of other syndicates, strip-mine abandoned timeline battlefields for residual Flux, and have developed crude but effective methods for extracting crystals from war-torn temporal debris. They scavenge crystals wherever they can be found — and have discovered something more (Kintsu).

### The Flux Paradox

> **All Flux flows to Soval.**

Regardless of who harvests it, how it is refined, or what purpose it serves, the energy released by temporal displacement ultimately feeds the Time Devourer at the end of all timelines. The mechanism is not fully understood — even Singularity's models can only approximate it — but the correlation is undeniable.

This creates an **impossible bind**:
- The syndicates *need* Flux to operate — to power their Cores, sustain their civilizations, and fight the Great Conflict.
- But every action they take to survive accelerates the thing that will ultimately destroy them all.
- Reducing Flux output would mean disarming, ceding territory, abandoning timelines to rival factions.
- No syndicate is willing to be the first to stop.

Syndicate responses to the paradox:
- Some deny it entirely
- Some acknowledge it but view it as an acceptable trade-off
- **Sungrace** believes they can wage war with the inevitable
- **Singularity** focuses on making things better for the living in the moment
- **Lifeblood** accepts it as part of the natural cycle
- **Phasetide's Cult of Finality** does not see it as a problem — they see it as a *sacrament*

## 3. KINTSU AND CHRONO CRYSTALS

> *"When you break a bowl, most people throw it away. We fill the cracks with gold. And the gold? The gold comes from every breaking that ever was."* — Vera, Original Proof

### What Is Kintsu?

Where Chrono Crystals are the common product of crystallized Flux, **Kintsu** is a rare and extraordinary alloy — a fusion of Chrono Crystal and specific minerals found only in certain geological formations across the multiverse. The result is a substance unlike anything else known to science or magic: a **molten golden metal** that is the only material known to *visibly and obviously interact with Flux energy*.

Chrono Crystals store Flux passively, like a battery. **Kintsu responds to it.** In the presence of active Flux, Kintsu glows, flows, and resonates. It can be shaped by will, directed by intent, and used as a conduit for temporal energy in ways that Chrono Crystals cannot.

> If Chrono Crystals are the fuel of the Great Conflict, Kintsu is its **living fire**.

### Discovery

Kintsu was first discovered by Splintergleam on the remote **Mount Veraki** — a massive volcano whose deep geological formations contained the precise mineral composition needed for the alloy to form naturally. The mountain's proximity to ancient, heavy diving activity had saturated its rock with Flux energy over millennia, and the interaction between that energy and the mountain's unique minerals produced **veins of molten gold running through the stone**.

It was on Mount Veraki that Kintsu **awakened Vera** — the being known as the Original Proof. Vera's emergence from the mountain demonstrated that Kintsu could bind, concentrate, and control massive amounts of temporal energy in ways never before observed. She became the living evidence of Kintsu's power, and Splintergleam's most compelling argument for the substance's importance.

Mount Veraki remains the only known location where Kintsu develops naturally. The alloyed molten Chrono Crystals and Flux that mix in the volcano create the conditions for natural Kintsu formation.

### Properties of Kintsu

**Flux Accumulation**: Kintsu naturally accumulates and concentrates in places of heavy diving activity and temporal conflict. Where battles rage across time, Kintsu seeps into the earth, pools in the cracks of shattered structures, and crystallizes in the wounds of the landscape. The more a place has been fought over, the richer its Kintsu deposits.

**Rune Magic**: Splintergleam's rune-magicians (the Kintsu-Kai) have developed techniques for inscribing Kintsu into patterns that channel and direct Flux energy. These runes can enhance weapons, fortify armor, heal wounds, and perform feats that other syndicates would classify as magic. The practice requires both skill and sacrifice — Kintsu responds to blood and pain as readily as it responds to Flux.

**Direct Consumption**: Kintsu can be consumed directly, flooding the user's body with concentrated temporal energy. The effects are dramatic and dangerous — enhanced strength, accelerated healing, heightened perception — but the cost is steep. Repeated consumption changes the user, physically and psychologically. (Shown in the Kintsu-Kai initiation rites, where supplicants embrace pain as part of the ritual.)

**Kintsugi Scarring**: Perhaps Kintsu's most visually distinctive property: **it fills wounds**. When a being marked by Kintsu suffers injury, the golden metal flows into the wound, sealing it with gleaming golden lines that strengthen the flesh beyond its original state. Splintergleam warriors wear their scars with pride — each golden line a testament to a battle survived, each break made more beautiful by its mending. (Example: Gritmancer Grant, whose pterosaur mount is covered in golden Kintsu cracks.)

### The Tragic Irony of Kintsu

Splintergleam's relationship with Kintsu contains a tragic irony that the syndicate itself does not fully understand:

- Kintsu accumulates in places of conflict. It concentrates where timelines shatter.
- It grows stronger with every battle, every dive, every act of temporal warfare.
- Splintergleam's philosophy — beauty in brokenness, strength through destruction, growth through pain — is **literally fueled by the Great Conflict itself**.
- The more timelines break, the more Kintsu accumulates. The more Kintsu accumulates, the stronger Splintergleam becomes. The stronger Splintergleam becomes, the more effectively they fight, generating more Flux, breaking more timelines, and producing more Kintsu in an accelerating cycle.
- **All of it ends up with Soval.**

Splintergleam guards Kintsu preciously across all timelines, treating deposits as sacred sites and reserves as strategic assets. Mount Veraki itself is a fortress, its Lavaborn defenders among the most formidable warriors in the multiverse. To threaten Splintergleam's Kintsu supply is to invite a response of extraordinary violence.

## 4. IMMORTALIZATION

> *"It is not that they become unkillable. It is that they become undeniable."* — Archivist notation on the phenomenon of Immortalization

### What Immortalization Is

**Immortalization** is not a literal process. There is no ritual, no machine, no spell that transforms a syndicate agent into an immortal being. It is not something that is done *to* someone, nor something that someone *achieves* through effort or merit in the conventional sense.

Immortalization is a **phenomenon** — observed, documented, but not fully understood — in which a being across the braided multiverse reaches their **absolute apex**. It is the moment when every version of a person, across every timeline in which they exist, converges toward a single, crystallized expression of who they truly are.

In an infinite multiverse, there are infinite versions of every person. Most are unremarkable — slight variations on a theme. But in some timelines, a person makes exactly the right choice at exactly the right moment. They become sharper, more defined, more *themselves*. Across the vast probability space of the multiverse, these exceptional versions begin to **resonate with one another**, reinforcing each other like harmonics in a chord.

Immortalization occurs when that resonance reaches **critical mass** — when one version of a person becomes so perfectly, intensely *themselves* that they embody everything their existence could ever mean. They become the **truest form of themselves across time** — the definitive expression, the apex variant.

**"The Rickiest Rick."**

### What Immortalization Is Not

- **Not literal immortality.** Immortalized beings can be killed, can age, can fail. What changes is not their durability but their *significance*.
- **Not exclusive to the powerful.** A humble farmer who perfectly embodies contentment and connection to the land is as valid a candidate as a galaxy-spanning warlord. What matters is not scale but *authenticity*.
- **Not permanent in the cosmic sense.** The multiverse is always shifting, always braiding new possibilities. An Immortalized being represents the apex of *current* probability — but the future is unwritten.

An Immortalized being carries the weight of their own archetype — they are not merely a person but a *statement*, a living thesis about what it means to be who they are.

### Immortalization in Gameplay: Base Form to Immortalized Form

In the card game, Immortalization is represented as a **card evolution system**:

- Each character has a **Base Form** (their standard state) and an **Immortalized Form** (their apex state).
- Each card has a specific **Immortalize Condition** that must be met during gameplay to trigger the transformation.
- Immortalized forms typically gain new abilities, keywords, and enhanced stats while retaining core identity traits.

**Examples of Immortalize Conditions** (from character bios):

| Character | Base Form | Immortalize Condition | Immortalized Form |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Fervent Mycologist (Jenny) | Evasive; field researcher | Must have struck the enemy Core | Jenny, Sower of Spores — gains Sprout 1 on Strike |
| Harbinger of Power | Shifts to Deadly Fauna on entry | Enemy Core damage dealt through Overpower | Evolution Incarnate — Confront; Shifts to Deadly Fauna at Round End |
| Lumbering Starseeker | Delay keyword; slow-moving entity | Must survive damage | Luminous Vengeance — gains Overpower and Confront |
| Gardener Apprentice (Oswald) | Sprouts 1 on entry | Must witness 4+ Sprout events | Horticulturist Oswald — Activate grants Seedling Overpower |
| Hungry Tyrannosaur | Confront, Overpower; Throwdown on entry | Must destroy an enemy Agent | Wreck-o Rex — gains Cleave |
| Kinetic Absorber (Dyson) | Confront; absorbs kinetic energy | Must survive an enemy strike | Dyson, the Aspirant — Advent shifts to Star Siphon |
| Spark of Bounty | Shifts to Abundant Growth on entry | 15+ Strength in play at Round End | Cosmic-scale embodiment of life's origin |
| Origination Engine | Resets all agents, empties Timeline Stack, erases graveyards | Empty hand required | (Immortalized form) |
| Territorial Pack | Summons Wolf token on entry | Round End with no allied Wolf in play | Boof, Lonely and Proud — lone survivor |
| Aardvark Precinct Captain (Tino) | Sprouts 1 per ally on entry | Round End with 5+ other allies | Tino, Majestic Stumbler — Shifts to Deadly Fauna |
| Bright-Eyed Supplicant | Confront; Lost rarity | Must survive damage twice | (Immortalized form via Kintsu-Kai rites) |
| Devourer Spawn (Soval card) | Gains random keywords per Timeline in stack | Lost rarity | Soval at End of Time — regenerates to full on destruction (consumes a Timeline) |

## 5. SOVAL AND THE END OF TIME

> *"It is not malice. It is not hunger. It is simply what happens when everything runs out of time."* — Kyln, the Dynasty, upon departing the Cult of Finality

### The End of Time

At the terminus of all timelines — beyond the last star, beyond the last breath of the last living thing, beyond even the quantum fluctuations of empty space — there is a place. It is not a place in any conventional sense. It has no coordinates, no geography, no fixed position in the timestream. It exists only as a destination: the point toward which every timeline, without exception, eventually converges.

The End of Time resembles nothing so much as the beginning. It is a **roiling chaos of undifferentiated energy, matter, and possibility** — a visual cacophony compared to the heart of the Big Bang, or the interior of a black hole, or both simultaneously. Colors that have no names churn through geometries that have no logic. Time itself breaks down at the boundary, loops and folds and collapses in on itself, so that "when" becomes as meaningless as "where."

Only the most powerful divers have ever reached the End of Time and returned. Most who have glimpsed it did so briefly, through a Chrono Core's navigational display, before pulling back in terror. The few who lingered describe not danger but *completeness* — as if every question they had ever asked was being answered simultaneously, in a language they could not quite understand.

### Soval, the Time Devourer

Soval is not an entity in the way that a person or even a god is an entity. Soval is a **force of nature** — the embodiment of the inevitable end of all things, the heat death of the multiverse given physical form.

**Visual manifestation**: An **infinite spiked ouroboros** — a serpentine form of impossible scale, coiled endlessly through the chaos of the End of Time, consuming its own tail in a cycle that has no beginning and no end. Its surface bristles with geometric spikes that fracture light into spectra that should not exist. It is simultaneously the most terrifying and the most beautiful thing that any observer has ever described.

**Nature**: Soval does not think. Soval does not choose. Soval does not hate the syndicates or wish for their destruction. Soval simply **is** — the natural consequence of a multiverse that generates more temporal energy than it can sustain. Soval exists almost as a natural byproduct of time splitting into infinite possibilities — its role is to reduce the infinite possibilities back down to zero. Like a living, reverse-Big-Bang.

Every timeline that reaches its natural end is consumed by Soval. Every unit of Flux that flows through the system ultimately arrives at Soval's threshold. The Time Devourer grows not through malice but through **thermodynamics**.

This is what makes Soval so profoundly difficult to confront. An enemy can be fought. A tyrant can be overthrown. A monster can be slain. But how do you fight entropy? How do you defeat the concept of "ending"?

### Syndicate Responses to Soval

| Syndicate | Response to Soval |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Sungrace** | Believes Soval can be starved or destroyed through sufficient energy manipulation. The Eternals dedicate their near-immortal existences to finding a weapon that can harm a force of nature. |
| **Singularity** | Models Soval as a system that might be redirected or contained, if only the right algorithm can be found. She runs simulations endlessly. |
| **Lifeblood** | Accepts Soval as the final stage of the natural cycle — death and renewal on a cosmic scale. Some believe what comes after Soval may be a new beginning. |
| **Silence** | Studies Soval from a distance, their Archivists recording everything. The Council has its own plans, spoken of only in whispers. They secretly share intelligence about Soval with both Sungrace and Singularity. |
| **Splintergleam** | Largely ignores Soval, focused on the immediate struggles of the Great Conflict. Their philosophy of "beauty in brokenness" does not extend to contemplating the end of everything — or perhaps it does, and they simply do not speak of it. |
| **Phasetide** | Officially teaches that the faithful will be preserved when the One True Timeline outlasts all others. Privately, the **Cult of Finality** worships Soval as the ultimate expression of divine will — the end of all suffering, the final peace. |

### Devourer Spawn

The chaos at the End of Time does not stay contained. Where timelines cross, tangle, or collide — particularly at sites of heavy diving activity or catastrophic temporal distortion — the boundary between the normal timestream and the End of Time can **thin**.

Through these thin points, **Devourer Spawn** emerge.

**What they are**: Not children of Soval in any reproductive sense. They are chaotic byproducts — fragments of the End of Time's undifferentiated energy that have leaked into the normal timestream and taken on semi-stable forms. They are **entropy given shape**: destructive, unpredictable, and utterly indifferent to the distinction between friend and foe.

**Variety**: Spawn vary enormously in form and power. Some are small — skittering anomalies that corrode matter and warp local time. Others are vast — howling storms of temporal distortion that can unmake entire cities. All share certain characteristics:
- They are drawn to Flux energy
- They are difficult to destroy by conventional means
- They serve no master

**Impact on the Great Conflict**: The appearance of Devourer Spawn at a timeline crossing is treated as a **natural disaster** by all syndicates. Temporary ceasefires are not uncommon when Spawn emerge — not out of altruism, but because Spawn threaten everyone equally, and the Flux energy they consume benefits no one.

**Warning sign**: Some scholars theorize that the **increasing frequency** of Spawn sightings is evidence that Soval is growing stronger — that the End of Time is creeping closer with every dive, every conflict, every unit of Flux generated by the Great Conflict. If this theory is correct, then the Devourer Spawn are not merely a hazard of temporal warfare. They are a **warning**.

### The Cult's Witness (First Sighting of Soval)

The first confirmed sighting of Soval occurred when Zel, the First Diver, was captured by the group that would become the Cult of Finality near the End of Time. Using his stolen Core, the Cult witnessed Soval directly — and the experience shattered them:

- **Some were broken**: Consumed by nihilistic certainty that nothing could prevent the end. These became the seed of the **Cult of Finality**, devoted to the belief that Soval's consumption of all timelines is not a catastrophe to be averted but a culmination to be embraced.
- **Others were galvanized**: **Kyln** looked upon Soval and felt not despair but *fury*. She departed the Cult and devoted herself to finding a way to stop what she had seen, founding **Sungrace** around the conviction that human ingenuity could triumph over even the death of time.

### Soval as a Card

The Time Devourer Soval card is classified as **Lost** rarity (the hardest to obtain). In base form, the Devourer Spawn gains random positive keywords for each Timeline in the stack, representing its ability to absorb properties from temporal energy. Upon Immortalization, the Spawn manifests as Soval at the End of Time, beyond containment or study. Its ability to **regenerate to full durability upon destruction** (while consuming a Timeline in the process) mechanically represents the fundamental nature of entropy: it cannot be permanently destroyed, only delayed at a cost. The Immortalized flavor text consists of two words: **"The End."**

## 6. THE BT/AT CALENDAR SYSTEM

> *"Every syndicate disagrees on everything except one thing: when it all went wrong."* — Common saying among Archivists

### Overview

The **BT/AT calendar** is the standard dating system used across all six syndicates of the Great Conflict. Despite their profound philosophical differences, every faction has adopted the same temporal reference point — a rare and telling consensus.

- **BT** = **Before Theft**
- **AT** = **After Theft**
- **Year 0 AT** = The moment Zel stole the first portable Chrono Core, activated it, and dove — the single act that shattered causality, created the braided multiverse, and set in motion everything that followed.

### Why the Theft?

The choice of Zel's theft as the universal epoch is **pragmatic rather than ideological**. In a multiverse where timelines diverge, reconverge, and braid around each other in infinite complexity, establishing any shared frame of reference is extraordinarily difficult.

But the Theft is the one event that exists in *every* timeline. It is the **singular point from which all timelines radiate** — the moment of original divergence. Before the Theft, there was one timeline. After the Theft, there were infinite timelines.

**The central irony**: The calendar that unites the factions commemorates the act that divided everything. The syndicates cannot agree on the meaning of time, the purpose of existence, or the correct response to the end of all things — but they can agree on the precise moment when time itself broke.

### Structure

The BT/AT calendar uses a conventional structure familiar to most human civilizations:

- **12 months** (January through December)
- **Standard day/week lengths** (7-day weeks, 24-hour days)
- **Leap year rules** preserved from pre-Theft Earth-standard calendars

This structure reflects the human origin of all six syndicates. Despite their radical divergence in philosophy and culture, the syndicates remain fundamentally human (or human-derived) institutions, and their timekeeping reflects this shared heritage.

Dates in BT count backward from Year 0. Dates in AT count forward.

### Key Dates

**BT Era:**
- **Far BT**: Endless human interstellar conflict
- **Late BT**: Coalition of pacifists and scientists create Singularity
- **Late BT**: Singularity constructs the Origination Engine (prototype Core)

**Year 0 AT:**
- Zel steals the first portable Chrono Core and dives to the far future

**Early AT:**
- Zel is captured by the Cult of Finality near the End of Time
- The Cult uses Zel's Core to witness Soval for the first time
- Kyln departs the Cult, devoting herself to opposing Soval
- Kyln becomes the first Eternal and founds Sungrace
- Sungrace proliferates Core technology; Cores are lost to pirates and criminals

**Middle AT:**
- The Cult of Finality establishes the Faith of the One, creating Phasetide's culture retroactively across timelines
- Lifeblood, Splintergleam, and Silence crystallize as distinct factions across the braided multiverse
- The Archivists form as a neutral historian society within Silence

**Ongoing:**
- The Great Conflict escalates across all timelines

### Maintained by the Archivists of Silence

The **Archivists of Silence** maintain the most rigorous temporal records, cross-referencing events across multiple timelines to establish the closest possible consensus dates. Their work is invaluable but imperfect — as they themselves would be the first to admit.

### A Note on Temporal Paradox

Dates in the BT/AT system should be understood as **approximate consensual references** rather than absolute markers. In a braided multiverse, the concept of "when" is inherently fuzzy. An event that occurred in "5 AT" in one timeline might correspond to "3 AT" or "12 AT" in another, depending on the rate of local temporal flow and the degree of timeline divergence.

## 7. CARD GAME MECHANICS (as referenced in character bios)

The following game mechanics are documented through character biographies and lore entries throughout the source material. This is not a formal rulebook but a compilation of every mechanical term and system referenced in the world-building text.

### Rarity System

Cards are classified by rarity, which reflects both gameplay availability and narrative significance:

| Rarity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Common** | Standard agents; widespread within their syndicate. (e.g., Malum is Common, indicating his philosophy is accessible to ordinary recruits.) |
| **Uncommon** | Mid-tier agents with notable abilities or roles. |
| **Rare** | Upper echelon operatives and powerful entities. (e.g., Grand Admiral Khaela is Rare; Dyson is Rare.) |
| **Lost** | The hardest classification to obtain. Reserved for beings who have transcended normal categories or represent extreme circumstances. (e.g., Devourer Spawn Soval, the Containment Breach, Singularity Khaela, the Bright-Eyed Supplicant.) Lost designation can indicate consciousness dispersed beyond recovery, commitment pushed beyond safe limits, or existential significance. |

Additional classification: **Divergent** — Exists outside the standard hierarchy, used for entities in support/infrastructure roles or those outside conventional taxonomy. (e.g., Singularity herself is classified as Divergent; the Debris Collector; the Rotting Rocker Ylka.)

### Card Evolution: Base Form and Immortalized Form

- Every character card has a **Base Form** and an **Immortalized Form**.
- Each card specifies an **Immortalize Condition** — a gameplay trigger that must be met to evolve the card.
- Immortalized forms gain enhanced abilities, new keywords, and often altered stats, while retaining core identity traits from the base form.

### Combat Keywords

Keywords define a card's combat behavior and tactical role:

| Keyword | Effect (as inferred from character descriptions) |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Evasive** | Ability to bypass obstacles or avoid direct engagement. Common on scouts, infiltrators, and aerial units. (e.g., Jenny, Grant, Specialist Boof, Penitent Star, Kyln.) |
| **Confront** | Forces enemies to engage directly; prevents bypassing. Common on tanks and aggressive melee fighters. (e.g., Hungry Tyrannosaur, Evolution Incarnate, Dyson, Gentle Frank.) |
| **Overpower** | Excess damage carries through to Core or other targets. Common on powerful offensive units. (e.g., Hungry Tyrannosaur, Harbinger of Power, Eruption Incarnate.) |
| **Cleave** | Deals damage to multiple targets simultaneously. (e.g., Wreck-o Rex gains Cleave on Immortalization.) |
| **Delay** | Reflects deliberate, slow movement or activation. (e.g., Lumbering Starseeker, Gentle Frank.) |
| **Siphon** | Drains vitality or energy from opponents. (e.g., Da'Kad the Bareknuckle Inquisitor; Clarion grants Siphon to Actions and Timelines.) |
| **Temporary** | Card has inherent instability; may not persist. (e.g., Singularity Khaela, reflecting dispersed consciousness.) |

### Abilities and Triggers

| Ability/Trigger | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Core Strike** | Ability to target and damage the enemy Core directly; some variants erase enemy graveyards. (e.g., Specialist Boof's Core Strike erases enemy graveyards.) |
| **Last Gasp** | Triggered upon the card's destruction/death. Passes effects or triggers events. (e.g., Malark passes combat bonuses to weakest ally; Quaid shifts battlefield to Star Siphon; Aris shifts to One True Timeline.) |
| **Reserve Energy** | Generated by certain cards to provide additional energy resources. (e.g., Peaceful Synthesizer generates Reserve Energy through Activate; Quaid's Strike generates Reserve Energy.) |
| **Activate** | An ability that can be triggered manually by the player. (e.g., Peaceful Synthesizer's Reserve Energy generation; Oswald's Seedling Overpower grant.) |
| **Advent** | Triggered when a card enters the battlefield; typically causes an immediate effect. (e.g., Dyson's Advent shifts to Star Siphon; Holder of the Instruments triggers a shift to One True Timeline.) |
| **Flourish** | Growth/strengthening effect, often triggered by survival or specific events. (e.g., Gritmancer Grant Flourishes when surviving damage; Ziv Flourishes on discard; Cycle Embodied Flourishes on Sprout/Decay/Flourish events.) |
| **Sprout** | Creates Seedling tokens. Core Lifeblood mechanic. (e.g., Jenny Sprouts 1 on Strike; Oswald Sprouts 1 on entry; Tino Sprouts 1 per ally on entry.) |
| **Decay** | Decomposition/entropy mechanic, often paired with Sprout and Flourish in Lifeblood's growth cycle. |
| **Shift** | Changes the active battlefield/environment to a different Timeline location. (e.g., Shift to Deadly Fauna, Shift to Abundant Growth, Shift to Star Siphon, Shift to Volcanic Rivers, Shift to One True Timeline.) |
| **On Entry** | Triggered when a card first enters play. (e.g., Harbinger Shifts to Deadly Fauna on entry; Tyrannosaur generates Throwdown on entry.) |
| **On Strike** | Triggered when a card attacks. (e.g., Jenny Sprouts 1 on Strike; Quicksilver Khaela generates Transient copies on Strike.) |
| **Round End** | Triggered at the conclusion of a round. Used for many Immortalize conditions and ongoing effects. |

### Tokens and Generated Cards

| Token/Card | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Seedling** | Small anthropomorphic plant creatures generated by Sprout abilities. Core to Lifeblood's strategy. Can be cultivated from tiny creatures into huge beasts of burden and war. |
| **Wolf** | Summoned by Territorial Pack on entry. Pack-based Lifeblood token. |
| **Throwdown** | Generated card created by aggressive units like Hungry Tyrannosaur. |
| **Transient** | Copies of a card that are inherently temporary. (e.g., Quicksilver Khaela generates Transient copies.) |

### Battlefields / Timeline Locations

Certain cards Shift the active environment, changing the battlefield to a specific Timeline location. Each location modifies gameplay conditions:

| Battlefield | Syndicate | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Deadly Fauna** | Lifeblood | Timeline where predation and competition are intensified. |
| **Abundant Growth** | Lifeblood | Timeline where natural growth is accelerated. |
| **Star Siphon** | Sungrace | Timeline where stellar energy can be directly harvested without immediate stellar collapse. |
| **Volcanic Rivers** | Sungrace | Shifted to by the Magmatic Tether when Action cards are played. |
| **One True Timeline** | Phasetide | The sacred timeline of the Faith of the One; several Phasetide cards shift to this location. |

### The Graveyard

The **graveyard** functions as a discard/destroyed-cards zone with strategic significance:

- Cards like Specialist Boof have Core Strike abilities that specifically **erase enemy graveyards**, disrupting opponent strategy.
- The Origination Engine's game effect includes **erasing all graveyards**, representing temporal reset.
- Vor-Kan generates extra Energy Crystals by **consuming cards from graveyards**.
- Grand Judge Dhael can **erase actions from the graveyard and recreate them at reduced cost**, representing judicial power to rewrite the record of events.
- A geist card depicts "the graveyard crumbling and breaking apart" as it rampages free.

### The Timeline Stack

The **Timeline Stack** appears to track active or layered Timeline/battlefield states:

- The Origination Engine empties the Timeline Stack as part of its reset effect.
- The Devourer Spawn gains random positive keywords for each Timeline in the stack.
- Immortalized Soval consumes a Timeline from the stack when it regenerates.

### Energy Crystals

**Energy Crystals** serve as the in-game resource for playing cards and activating abilities:

- The Debris Collector's strength scales with the player's Energy Crystals.
- The Hidden Locus provides a steady extra Energy Crystal each round.
- Vor-Kan generates extra Energy Crystals by consuming graveyard cards.
- Diegetically, Energy Crystals represent Chrono Crystals — crystallized Flux energy.

### Strength

**Strength** is a core combat stat for agent cards:

- Cards like Wom reduce enemy agents' Strength.
- Spark of Bounty's Immortalize condition requires 15+ total Strength in play.
- The Sapling Dryad / Great Oakmother has Sprout-scaling Strength bonuses.

Every mechanic reinforces the central tragic irony: the tools built to save humanity accelerate its destruction, and no one is willing to stop.
