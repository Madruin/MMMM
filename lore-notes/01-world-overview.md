## The Chronoverse — Core Premise

Humanity's future was an endless cycle of interstellar war. From the exhaustion of this conflict, a coalition of pacifists and scientists built **Singularity** — a benevolent AI of unprecedented scope tasked with solving human self-destruction.

Singularity succeeded beyond expectation. She developed the **Chrono Core** — a device capable of folding time upon itself, intended as a precision surgical tool to carefully rewrite the roots of conflict.

### The Theft & The Braiding

**Zel**, a scientist in Singularity's foundry, miniaturized the Origination Engine (the room-sized prototype) into the first portable Chrono Core. He stole it, activated it, and dove to the far future. This single act:

- **Shattered causality** — the timeline *braided*, with infinite timelines weaving around each other
- Created the **multiverse** as a chaotic, infinite web of possible histories
- Marks **Year 0 AT** (After Theft) — the shared calendar epoch for all factions

### The Great Conflict

As Chrono Core technology proliferated, six philosophies crystallized into six **Syndicates**, each fighting across every era of history using the **Butterfly Effect** itself — developing entire timelines, nudging civilizations, competing for the shape of reality.

The Great Conflict is not a single war but an **infinite game of chess** played across every timeline simultaneously, where the pieces are civilizations and the stakes are reality itself.

## The Flux Paradox — Central Tragic Irony

Every dive generates **Flux** — supernova-scale bursts of neutrino energy that are invisible to civilians but harvestable by syndicates. Crystallized Flux becomes **Chrono Crystals**, the universal currency of the Great Conflict.

**All Flux ultimately flows toward Soval, the Time Devourer** — an incomprehensible force of nature at the End of Time that consumes timelines as they reach their terminus. Soval is not a character but entropy given physical form — an infinite spiked ouroboros.

**The central paradox**: The Chrono Core was built to end conflict, but created the Great Conflict. The Great Conflict generates Flux. Flux feeds Soval. **The more the syndicates fight, the faster everything ends.** No syndicate is willing to be the first to stop.

## Key Concepts

### Immortalization
A **phenomenon** — not a ritual — in which a being across the braided multiverse reaches their absolute apex. When one version of a person becomes so perfectly, intensely *themselves* that they embody everything their existence could mean, they become the **truest form of themselves across time**. "The Rickiest Rick." It does not grant literal immortality; it grants *significance*.

### Chrono Cores & Diving
- **Origination Engine**: Singularity's room-sized prototype — the first time machine
- **Chrono Core**: Portable version; punches holes in causality, threads users through time
- **Diving**: Using a Core to travel through time; fundamental act driving the Great Conflict
- Each syndicate has unique Core variants (seed-pods, blood rituals, star siphons, etc.)
- Every dive generates Flux, alerting other syndicates and feeding Soval

### Kintsu & Chrono Crystals
- **Chrono Crystals**: Common crystallized Flux; batteries that store temporal energy passively
- **Kintsu**: Rare alloy of Chrono Crystal + specific minerals; a *molten golden metal* that actively responds to Flux energy. Can be shaped by will, heals wounds with golden scarring (kintsugi philosophy). Found naturally only at **Mount Veraki**. Can be consumed directly (dangerous), inscribed as runes, or used to fill wounds.
- Tragic irony: Kintsu accumulates in places of conflict, so Splintergleam grows stronger the more war there is

### The BT/AT Calendar
- **BT** = Before Theft; **AT** = After Theft
- Year 0 AT = Zel's dive (the moment all timelines radiate from)
- Standard 12-month Gregorian structure (human heritage)
- Maintained by the Archivists of Silence
- Irony: the calendar that unites the factions commemorates the act that divided everything

### Devourer Spawn
- Chaotic byproducts of the End of Time leaking into normal timestream
- Entropy given shape; destructive, unpredictable, drawn to Flux
- Temporary ceasefires occur when Spawn emerge (they threaten everyone equally)
- Increasing frequency suggests Soval is growing stronger

## The Six Syndicates (Summary)

| Syndicate | Color | Question | Core Philosophy |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Lifeblood** | Green | "Can I find peace in impermanence?" | Nature's champions; connection of all living things; growth through decay and renewal |
| **Sungrace** | Orange | "Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable?" | Last line against entropy; far-future tech; resist heat death at any cost |
| **Silence** | Purple | "Can solitude be enough?" | Telepaths and isolationists; hidden knowledge; the spaces between worlds |
| **Singularity** | Chrome | "Can I let go of self to become something greater?" | Benevolent AI overmind; guilt for creating the Chrono Core; seeks peace endlessly |
| **Splintergleam** | Red/Gold | "Can broken things find purpose? Is freedom free?" | Kintsugi philosophy; strength through destruction; beauty in brokenness |
| **Phasetide** | Royal Blue | "Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer?" | Theocratic society; One True Timeline; secret Cult of Finality worships Soval |

## Aesthetic & Genre

Chrono exists at the intersection of **science fiction and fantasy, time travel and mythology**. The aesthetic is deliberately **timeless** — medieval knights alongside starship captains, druids casting spells in the shadow of fusion reactors, telepathic wolf packs hunting necromancers alongside gunslinger-android duels. Magic and science coexist because every era exists simultaneously in the braided multiverse.

## Cross-Syndicate Characters

Several characters appear as variants across multiple or all syndicates:
- **Khaela** — 6 variants (one per syndicate), a multiversal constant
- **Boof** — 6 variants (a dog/canine in various forms per syndicate)
- **Bronk** — 2+ variants (a pilgrim shaped by each faction's philosophy)
- **Alina** — 2+ variants (each reflecting a different philosophy of giving/taking)

No in-universe explanation for why these archetypes recur has been established yet (noted as a gap in the Narrative Review).
