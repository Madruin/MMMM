## Sungrace (Orange — Fight Entropy)

*"Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable?"*

### Eternals

**Kyln, the Dynasty** (Base: The First Eternal)
> *I will not let the light go out.*
- **FOUNDER OF SUNGRACE**. Left the Cult of Finality after witnessing Soval, driven by horror and fury. Through mastery of energy conservation, she became the first Eternal — a being who has learned to resist entropy at a personal level. Founded Sungrace and created additional Eternals. Her dynasty is the civilization she built to fight the death of the universe.

**Penitent Star** (Base: Containment Breach)
> *I never wanted this.*
- A sentient being of pure plasma created when Sungrace researchers attempted to imbue magmatically charged energy with conscious thought. The experiment exceeded its parameters — the resulting entity broke free, destroying the facility and its creator (Mechanist 3247). Upon Immortalization, becomes the Penitent Star — drifting through interstellar space, isolation chosen to prevent further harm. **Lost rarity** (hardest classification). Deals escalating damage based on Reserve Energy.

**Living Comet** (Base: Falling Star)

### Remnant Guard

**Gentle Frank** (Base: Trench Keeper)

**Sungarden Protector** (Base: Field of Eternal Bloom)
> Guards the Sungardens — Sungrace installations where energy is cultivated in the form of perpetually blooming fields. The beauty they protect is both literal and philosophical.

**Luminous Vengeance** (Base: The Blinding)
> A warrior of pure light energy who strikes with devastating radiance. Base form, "The Blinding," is an indiscriminate burst; Immortalized form channels that energy into purposeful retribution.

**Dyson, the Aspirant**
> Named after the Dyson sphere concept. An engineer-warrior who aspires to capture the total energy output of stars. Represents Sungrace's grandest ambitions.

**Malark, the Silver Wave**

**Quaid, the Willing** (Base: Brilliant Martyr)
> *Some things are worth burning for.* / Base: *Dust to Dust.* / Immortalized: *Ash to Star.*
- Embodies Sungrace's core transaction: exchanging personal deterioration for energy. In base form, a radiant being with crumbling, disintegrating hands reaching out to cradle a star. Immortalized: the star now pulses within his chest. Common rarity — willing self-sacrifice is widespread in Sungrace's lower ranks, not an anomaly. Death audio: loses control of the star inside him.

**Malum, the Fist**
> A brute-force combatant in the Remnant Guard. Where others fight with technology and finesse, Malum fights with concentrated power.

### Second Law Fleet

**Grand Admiral Khaela** (Sungrace Khaela variant)
> *The fleet moves as one.*
- Supreme commander of the Second Law Fleet, Sungrace's primary military force. Named after the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which they literally fight against). Personally selected Boof as her second in command, citing absolute faith in skill and loyalty. Fierce, strategic, and utterly committed to the war against entropy.

**Doctor Mirthram Remora** (Base: Medic Mirthram)
> A fleet physician who develops new methods to sustain life and combat the effects of entropy on biological systems. His Immortalized form represents medical science pushed to its theoretical limits.

**Mechanist Daedalus**
> Named after the mythological inventor. A brilliant engineer aboard the Second Law Fleet who designs increasingly ambitious machines to harvest and redirect energy. Like his namesake, the question is whether his creations will fly or fall.

**Specialist Boof** (Sungrace Boof variant)
> *But it's a DOG!*
- A steampunk-augmented mechanical hound serving as Grand Admiral Khaela's personal adjutant. Base form conducts reconnaissance and infiltration. Immortalized form: a relaxed, happy dog lying on its back in a sunbeam — yet retains full combat effectiveness. Interaction with Khaela: "Who's my good boy?" Embodies a Sungrace theme: things worth protecting are often simple and unassuming.

**Chaos Conductor Boltz** (Base: Jury of the Second Law)
> *Sometimes even the laws of physics need good representation.*
- Base form is a squad of high-tech marines in containment suits with entropy-capture devices. Boltz himself is a wild-eyed scientist-turned-soldier who treats thermodynamic equations as combat doctrine. Embodies Sungrace's literal war against the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

## Silence (Purple — Telepaths & Isolationists)

**Wilfred, Lobotomizer**
> An enforcer whose methods are as brutal as the name suggests. Operates on the principle that some knowledge is too dangerous to exist in any mind. Silence's most feared operative.

**The Strand**
> A being who exists as a thread of consciousness woven through multiple minds simultaneously. Represents Silence's telepathic network at its most abstract.

**Khaela, the Vanished** (Silence Khaela variant)
> The Silence version of Khaela — one who has been partially erased, existing in the spaces between memory and forgetting. Her "vanishing" may be voluntary or imposed.

### The Archivists

**Dhali, Bearer of Memories**
> An Archivist who carries the preserved memories of others, serving as a living library. The weight of accumulated memory defines their existence.

> A telepathic canine who listens to the thoughts of others. The Silence version of Boof — loyal, perceptive, and attuned to the unspoken.

**Indara, the Candle** (Base: Solemn Attendant)
> *Every tombstone honored the same.*
- A burial worker who tends graves within Silence's territories, performing rites of remembrance for every deceased creature regardless of size. Treats the burial of a hamster with the same gravity as a hero's funeral. Immortalized: can call forth spirits of small creatures buried under their care — ghosts of hamsters, mice, and other small beloved creatures rise at Indara's summons. Demonstrates that memory is an active force that reciprocates.

### The Whisper Network

**Witch of the Woods**

Shae'Fan is imprisoned at the Outer Shore, the Council's space-based prison. Was once a savior, was enslaved, and now embodies vengeance. The Council fears the consequences of Shae'Fan being fully freed or fully forgotten. One of Silence's most closely guarded secrets.

## Singularity (Chrome — AI Overmind)

*"Can I let go of self to become something greater?"*

End." **Lost rarity.** Represents either the fullest expression of Singularity's philosophy or something that should not exist.

### Nostradans

**Boatswain Corvus** (Pilot of the Gilded Behemoth)

Corvus is its pilot, risen from low Nostradan station through strategic genius. His eyes are pure gold, the Kintsu having replaced their original color.

His base form, "Chrono Thief," frames him as criminal; his Immortalized title acknowledges him as the pivotal figure of all history.
