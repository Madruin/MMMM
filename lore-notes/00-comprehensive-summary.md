## What Is Chrono CCG?

A collectible card game set in **The Chronoverse** — a braided multiverse of infinite timelines created by a catastrophic act of time theft. The game blends science fiction, fantasy, mythology, and time travel into a deliberately timeless aesthetic where medieval knights fight alongside starship captains, druids cast spells in the shadow of fusion reactors, and telepathic wolf packs hunt necromancers.

**Source material**: 256 resources exported from [LegendKeeper](https://legendkeeper.com) on 2026-02-27, containing 6 factions, ~100+ unique characters (many with card variants), 13+ locations, 10 short stories, and extensive world-building documents.

## The Core Story

### Act 1: The Problem
Humanity's future was an endless cycle of interstellar war. A coalition of pacifists and scientists built **Singularity** — a benevolent AI of unprecedented scope — to solve human self-destruction.

### Act 2: The Solution That Became the Problem
Singularity created the **Origination Engine** — a room-sized prototype capable of folding spacetime. Scientist **Zel** miniaturized it into the first portable **Chrono Core**, stole it, and dove to the far future. This single act:
- Shattered causality — the timeline *braided*
- Created the multiverse as an infinite web of possible histories
- Marks **Year 0 AT** (After Theft) — the shared calendar epoch

### Act 3: The Great Conflict
Six philosophies crystallized into six **Syndicates**, each fighting across every era using the **Butterfly Effect** itself — developing timelines, nudging civilizations, competing for the shape of reality. The Great Conflict is not a single war but an infinite game of chess played across every timeline simultaneously.

### The Central Tragic Irony: The Flux Paradox
Every dive generates **Flux** — supernova-scale neutrino energy invisible to civilians but harvestable by syndicates. Crystallized Flux becomes **Chrono Crystals**, the universal currency.

**All Flux ultimately flows to Soval, the Time Devourer** — entropy incarnate at the End of Time. The more the syndicates fight, the faster everything ends. No syndicate is willing to be the first to stop.

## The Six Syndicates

| # | Syndicate | Color | Question | Philosophy | Key Leader |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | **Lifeblood** | Green | Can I find peace in impermanence? | Nature's cycle; growth through decay | The Great Oakmother |
| 2 | **Sungrace** | Orange | Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable? | Fight entropy at any cost | Kyln, the Dynasty (founder) |
| 3 | **Silence** | Purple | Can solitude be enough? | Telepaths; hidden knowledge | The Council of Silence |
| 4 | **Singularity** | Chrome | Can I let go of self to become something greater? | Benevolent AI overmind; guilt-driven peace | Singularity herself |
| 5 | **Splintergleam** | Red/Gold | Can broken things find purpose? | Kintsugi philosophy; beauty in brokenness | Master of Ceremonies |
| 6 | **Phasetide** | Royal Blue | Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer? | One True Timeline; theocratic faith | First Mother/Father |

### Faction Subfactions

- **Lifeblood**: Druids, Eco-Terrorists, Saurians, The Wilds, Lavaborn
- **Sungrace**: Eternals, Remnant Guard, Second Law Fleet
- **Silence**: Council of Silence, The Archivists, The Whisper Network
- **Singularity**: Her Creations, Cyborgs, Amalgams/Rogues
- **Splintergleam**: The Arena, Nostradans, Rune-Magicians, Myths
- **Phasetide**: Faith of the One, Heretics, Cult of Finality

### Key Relationship Dynamics
- **Sungrace vs. Soval**: The most direct opposition — Sungrace literally fights entropy
- **Singularity vs. Phasetide**: Both value order, but Singularity undermines Phasetide's thought control
- **Lifeblood vs. Sungrace**: Nature's acceptance of death vs. engineering's refusal of it
- **Silence vs. Everyone**: Hoards knowledge; distrusted universally
- **Splintergleam vs. Everyone**: Grows stronger from conflict; benefits from war existing
- **Phasetide's hidden rot**: The Cult of Finality is hidden inside, actively feeding Soval

## Key World Mechanics

### Chrono Cores & Diving
Portable time machines that punch holes in causality. Each syndicate has unique Core variants (seed-pods, star siphons, telepathic navigation, chrome cores, Kintsu-infused cores, ritual-based diving). Every dive generates Flux and alerts other syndicates.

### Flux & Chrono Crystals
Neutrino energy from temporal displacement. Crystallized into Chrono Crystals (universal currency). Each syndicate harvests differently: Sungrace industrially, Singularity efficiently, Phasetide religiously, Silence telepathically, Lifeblood biologically, Splintergleam through scavenging.

### Kintsu
A rare alloy of Chrono Crystal + specific minerals. A molten golden metal that responds to Flux energy, can be shaped by will, and heals wounds with golden scarring (kintsugi philosophy). Found naturally only at **Mount Veraki**. Can be consumed, inscribed as runes, or used to fill wounds. **Tragic irony**: accumulates in places of conflict, making Splintergleam stronger the more war there is.

### Immortalization
A phenomenon (not a ritual) where a being reaches their absolute apex across all timelines — becoming the truest form of themselves. "The Rickiest Rick." Grants *significance*, not literal immortality. In gameplay: Base form → Immortalized form card evolution.

### Soval & The End of Time
Soval is not a character but entropy given physical form — an infinite spiked ouroboros at the boundary of existence. Devourer Spawn (entropy given shape) leak from the End of Time into normal timestream, causing temporary ceasefires. Their increasing frequency indicates Soval growing stronger.

### The BT/AT Calendar
BT (Before Theft) / AT (After Theft). Year 0 = Zel's dive. Maintained by the Archivists of Silence. Dates are approximate — in a braided multiverse, "when" is inherently fuzzy.

## Major Unresolved Plot Threads

1. **Zel's Fate** — Captured by Cult of Finality; current status unknown
2. **The Pre-Theft Anomaly** — Evidence of pre-BT temporal technology; if something predates Singularity, her foundational guilt may be misplaced
3. **Soval's Growth** — Devourer Spawn appearing with increasing frequency
4. **Secret Parallel Solutions** — Five syndicates are independently working on stopping Soval/entropy without knowing the others are too
5. **Cross-Syndicate Character Mystery** — Why do Khaela, Boof, Bronk, and Alina recur across all factions? No explanation established
6. **The Cult of Finality** — Secret death cult inside Phasetide; some of the highest-ranking members are operatives
7. **Singularity's Guilt** — The AI who started it all keeps seeking peace and failing
8. **Kintsu Accumulation** — Splintergleam grows stronger with every conflict; accelerating cycle

## Narrative Review Findings (Meta)

The world-building includes a self-aware **Narrative Review** document that identifies:
- **Strengths**: All 6 syndicates have consistent existential questions; strong tragic irony; well-developed faction relationships
- **Gaps identified**: Cross-syndicate character explanation missing; some subfaction detail incomplete; Core Set Plot Threads document is a stub
- **Recommendations**: Develop the Pre-Theft Anomaly; explain cross-faction archetypes; flesh out Heretics subfaction; resolve Zel's fate
