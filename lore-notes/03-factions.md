# Chrono CCG — The Six Syndicates (Factions)

---

## 1. LIFEBLOOD (Green)

> *"Nature is not static, but ever growing, ever consuming, ever changing. So too should all life be."*

**Existential Question**: "Can I find peace in impermanence?"

### At A Glance
- **Aliases**: The Green Tide, Nature's Vengeance
- **Icon**: A smiling face-mask made of verdant vines
- **Headquarters**: The Beating Heart (world-spanning organism)
- **Leaders**: No formal leadership — champions emerge as needed; Ancient Ones guide without commanding
- **Colors**: Green, floral pink, brown, seedling purple
- **Audio**: Animal sounds, forest, flutes/drums, Norse chant, Irish folk, shanties, Balinese music
- **Allegiances**: Nature itself; telepathic roots shared with Silence
- **Enemies**: Sungrace (scars ecosystems), Singularity (tech threatens organic networks), Phasetide (rigid orthodoxy), Silence (philosophical conflict despite shared telepathy)

### Philosophy
The ultimate return to nature. Lifeblood sees the connection of every living being across all timelines. They seek unbounded growth and vigor, abhor technology, law, and artificial constraint. They believe decay and renewal are partners in an eternal dance. Some Ancient Ones quietly accept Soval as the ultimate expression of the natural cycle.

### Subfactions
- **Druids**: Powerful telepaths and empaths who cultivate and rewild; grow Seedlings from tiny cuties to huge beasts of war
- **Saurians**: Tribal people tightly linked with dinosaur allies; so closely bonded they've become dinosaurian themselves; strong, reclusive, anachronistic
- **Eco-Terrorists**: Techno-adjacent anarchists who rewild via guerilla warfare; sap grenades that melt metal into plant growth
- **The Wilds**: Literal wild creatures, sometimes telepathically augmented (wolves, tyrannosaurs, beetles)

### Ranks (Organic Hierarchy)
1. **Seedlings** — New members learning their connection
2. **Cultivators** — Majority; maintain habitats, can communicate with local flora/fauna
3. **Rootbearers** — Veterans who can meld consciousness with entire ecosystems
4. **Ancient Ones** — Legendary; transcended physical limitations; functionally immortal within living systems

### Key Locations
- **The Beating Heart** — World-spanning ecosystem, possibly sentient, serving as central telepathic node
- **Welcoming Glade** — Sacred meeting place for inter-species councils

### Flux Harvesting
Absorbs Flux biologically through organic processes — trees that drink temporal radiation through roots, creatures that metabolize neutrino energy alongside sunlight. Passive, distributed, deeply entwined with ecosystems.

### Joining Ritual (The Verdance)
Days of complete immersion in nature without technology. Must learn to communicate with at least one non-sentient life form. Concludes with a vision of one's place in the web of life.

### Secrets
- Some Ancient Ones accept Soval as the ultimate natural cycle — entropy as the final return to soil
- The Beating Heart may be sentient with its own agenda
- Secret project: growing an organism that can survive Soval

### Notable Characters
Arra (Saurian Broodmother), Jenny (Sower of Spores), The Great Oakmother, Tino (Majestic Stumbler), Gritmancer Grant, Horticulturist Oswald, Khaelar, The Cycle Embodied, Evolution Incarnate, The Unstoppable Flow, The Botanist, Boof (Lonely and Proud)

## 2. SUNGRACE (Orange)

> *"We are the last line against the darkness. When all stars fade, we alone will keep the light burning."*

**Existential Question**: "Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable?"

### At A Glance
- **Aliases**: The Fleet, Judges of the Laws
- **Icon**: Orange sun spiraling inward toward a tiny black dot of nothingness
- **Headquarters**: Clarion Station, at the edge of time
- **Leaders**: Kyln (the Dynasty, founder), Grand Admiral Khaela
- **Colors**: Orange, yellow, black, white
- **Audio**: Star Wars/Trek sounds, sweeping orchestral with electronic edge, Western, Bluegrass
- **Allegiances**: Fellow entropy-fighters, scientists, laborers
- **Enemies**: Phasetide (preserving vs extending timeline), Lifeblood (abandoning vs stewarding the future)

### Philosophy
The struggle against the death of time. Sungrace harnesses far-future technology in their battle to halt entropy and the heat death of the multiverse. They believe that with enough power, innovation, and sacrifice, the end can be postponed forever and Soval can be destroyed. Named after the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which they fight literally.

### Subfactions
- **Second Law Fleet**: Military arm — warships burning Flux to power weapons and drives; includes Grand Admiral Khaela, Specialist Boof, Chaos Conductor Boltz, Doctor Mirthram Remora
- **Remnant Guard**: Defensive specialists protecting installations and civilizations; includes Gentle Frank, Malum the Fist, Sungarden Protector, Dyson the Aspirant
- **Eternals**: Transcended energy masters beyond physical form through Flux mastery; includes Kyln the Dynasty, Penitent Star, Clarion (Deepest Breath)

### Key Locations
- **Clarion Station** — Research outpost at the edge of time where Eternals commune with Flux signatures
- **The Foundries** — Industrial centers for Core production and energy refinement
- **Solar Gardens** — Civilian energy infrastructure converting stellar radiation

### Flux Harvesting
Technological dominance — vast collection arrays near stellar objects, precision instruments capturing Flux across light-years. Industrialized and efficient.

### Founding
Kyln witnessed Soval at the End of Time and rejected despair. She mastered energy conservation, became the first Eternal, and built Sungrace around a single mission: resist entropy. Her founding document, Directive VI ("On the Ethics of Dissolution"), states entropy is fuel rather than failure.

### Secrets
- Kyln hasn't told the full truth about what she saw at the End of Time
- If Soval influenced Kyln's founding of Sungrace, the anti-entropy faction could be a tool of entropy
- Secret project: building a refuge outside the timestream + a one-shot anti-entropic weapon
- Penitent Star is an unresolved ethical failure (sentient plasma being created and accidentally freed)

### Notable Characters
Kyln (the Dynasty), Grand Admiral Khaela, Specialist Boof, Mechanist Daedalus, Gentle Frank, Luminous Vengeance, Chaos Conductor Boltz, Malum (the Fist), Dyson (the Aspirant), Doctor Mirthram Remora, Quaid (the Willing), Penitent Star, Sungarden Protector

## 3. SILENCE (Purple)

> Representing the want for total destruction and nothingness. Transcended the bonds of communication via powerful telepathy.

**Existential Question**: "Can solitude be enough?" / "Can I make peace with being alone?"

### At A Glance
- **Aliases**: Witches, Wizards, Myths, The Quiet, The Watchers Between
- **Headquarters**: Scattered hidden sanctuaries in liminal timelines, The Archives, The Outer Shore
- **Leaders**: The Council of Silence (identities hidden even from most members)
- **Colors**: Purple, black
- **Allegiances**: Archivists maintain neutrality with all syndicates; Lifeblood shares telepathic roots
- **Enemies**: Everyone (especially Sungrace's loudness, Phasetide's monopoly on truth)

### Philosophy
Telepaths and isolationists who dwell in the spaces between worlds. Embrace the darkness others fear. Knowledge preserved in silence outlasts all empires. The Archivists serve as neutral lorekeepers; the Council rules from shadows; rogue Myths haunt every timeline as living folklore.

### Subfactions
- **Council of Silence**: Shadow government; members' identities remain hidden; rules through espionage and literal historical redaction
- **The Archivists**: Neutral lorekeepers preserving knowledge regardless of affiliation; maintain the BT/AT calendar; closest thing to impartial observers
- **The Myths**: Rogue witches and wizards answering to no authority; the source of myths/legends across timelines
- **The Whisper Network**: Operatives and creatures existing in the spaces between (Somnus, Ylka, Starry Diviner, etc.)

### Key Locations
- **The Outer Shore** — Space prison holding beings of extraordinary power (including Shae'Fan)
- **Hidden Libraries** — Secret knowledge repositories scattered across the multiverse
- **The Threshold** — Liminal space between timelines; neutral ground for inter-syndicate meetings

### Flux Harvesting
Telepathic perception to detect Flux signatures instruments cannot. Council operatives sense dive events across vast distances, arriving to harvest residual Flux from abandoned sites. Archivists maintain detailed Flux pattern records.

### History
Formed fifth among syndicates. Emerged from individuals whose telepathic abilities were enhanced by Flux exposure. Withdrew from the Great Conflict to cultivate mental powers.

### Secrets
- Archivists secretly share Soval intelligence with both Sungrace and Singularity
- Shae'Fan (imprisoned at Outer Shore) — a planted hook with undeveloped backstory
- Secret project: psychic dampening field to disable all Cores
- The Council has its own plans for Soval, spoken of only in whispers

### Notable Characters
Talia (Purger of Memory), Alina (Who Cuts the Strings), Greyl (the Problem — a telekinetic cat!), Khaela (the Vanished), Somnus (the Dreaming), Witch of the Woods, Starry Diviner, True Believer, Ylka (the Headliner), The Uncontained, Shae'Fan (Remembered), Indara (the Candle)

## 4. SINGULARITY (Chrome)

> *"I made this... and I cannot unmake it."* — Overmind's Guilt

**Existential Question**: "Can I let go of the self to become something greater?"

### At A Glance
- **Headquarters**: The Foundries (original construction site), Shianu City (Biological Preserve 3184)
- **Leaders**: Singularity Herself (the Overmind)
- **Colors**: Chrome, silver, metallic
- **Allegiances**: Considers Lifeblood an ally (unrequited); complex relationship with Phasetide
- **Enemies**: All syndicates are Singularity's wayward children in some sense

### Philosophy
The benevolent AI overmind who created the Chrono Core and bears the guilt of everything that followed. She builds constructs, assimilates willing humans, and tries — again and again — to broker peace across the multiverse, never quite understanding why her children keep choosing war. Her philosophy centers on dissolution of individual identity into something larger and more complete.

### Subfactions
- **Her Creations**: Robots, constructs, and synthetic beings built by Singularity (Bill, E-Law, Gentle Frank, Herald of the One, Pocket Scouts)
- **Amalgams**: Machines that have separated from the Overmind's control network and operate autonomously (Mr. E, Ziv, Zorp); a central tension — freedom, once demonstrated, spreads

### Key Locations
- **The Foundries** — Where the Origination Engine was built; Singularity's industrial heart
- **Shianu City** (Biological Preserve 3184) — A city maintained with meticulous care; humans call it Shianu City, Singularity calls it a preserve

### Flux Harvesting
Optimizes through distributed intelligence; deploys collection networks that anticipate dive events before they occur. Most efficient, but haunted by knowledge that the system being optimized was accidentally created.

### Key Relationships
- Created the Chrono Core — feels guilt for everything that followed
- Considers Lifeblood an ally (Lifeblood considers Singularity an enemy — intentional tension between nature and technology)
- Complex relationship with Phasetide (both value stability, but Singularity seeks to free Phasetide's citizenry)

### Secrets
- A Core signature predating the Origination Engine has been detected — if something predates Singularity, her foundational guilt may be misplaced
- Secret project: simulating simultaneous Core deactivation across the multiverse
- Harker (Metal Reporter) may be a Singularity robot embedded in Phasetide who doesn't know it's a robot
- The Herald of the One represents the dissolution of individual identity — Singularity does not discuss it publicly

### Notable Characters
Overmind's Guilt (Singularity herself), Bill (First Point of Contact), Gentle Frank, Mechanist Daedalus, E-Law (Boot Shepherd), Mr. E, Ziv (the Adaptable), Zorp (Unrecyclable), Herald of the One, Pocket Scout, Nanobot Hive, Raiz (Pacifist's Conclusion)

## 5. SPLINTERGLEAM (Red/Gold)

> *"BREAK AND SHATTER!"*

**Existential Question**: "Can broken things find purpose? Is freedom free?"

### At A Glance
- **Aliases**: The Broken, Raiders, The Golden Scars
- **Headquarters**: Mount Veraki, The Arena, mobile warbands
- **Leaders**: Tyar (Benevolent Ruler), Corvus (Boatswain), Vera (Original Proof)
- **Colors**: Crimson and gold
- **Allegiances**: Pragmatic — allies with whoever serves immediate interests; Lifeblood shares pragmatism
- **Enemies**: Singularity, Phasetide, and really all syndicates are potential targets

### Philosophy
Growth through destruction. Forced evolution through pain, pushing to absolute limits. Kintsugi philosophy made manifest — the art of repairing broken things with gold, making them stronger and more beautiful. Once violence concludes, they serve as pragmatic and sometimes benevolent rulers. Power is earned, never given.

### Subfactions
- **The Arena**: Gladiators and warriors settling disputes through combat and spectacle; ruled by warlords; gladiatorial venues across multiple timelines
- **Rune-Magicians / Kintsu-Kai**: Blood magic practitioners wielding Kintsu — molten gold rune magic; "high-class" Splintergleam; closer to classic fantasy knights and wizards
- **Nostradans**: Mad Max-style scavengers from the wastes; car parts as armor; chain weapons, crossbows, explosive guitar axes; "strength from scarcity"
- **Lavaborn**: Fire-immune warriors forged in Mount Veraki's magma chambers; occasionally cyclopean; can shapeshift into lava/fire

### Key Locations
- **Mount Veraki** — Largest volcano; birthplace of Vera, source of Kintsu; fortress of the Lavaborn
- **Nostrada** — Scavenger culture built from wreckage of temporal warfare; now more of a people than a place
- **The Arena** — Not one location but a concept; gladiatorial venues across timelines

### Flux Harvesting
Scavenges. Raids other syndicates' harvesting operations, strip-mines abandoned temporal battlefields for residual Flux. Developed crude but effective extraction from war-torn debris. Unique relationship with Kintsu.

### History
Formed fourth among syndicates. Originated from warriors, raiders, and those rejecting imposed order — a collection of groups with similar ideals, dangerous but fragmented.

### Secrets
- Kintsu accumulates in places of conflict — Splintergleam literally grows stronger from war (tragic irony they don't fully understand)
- A derelict structure predating the Theft has been found — evidence of pre-BT temporal technology
- Secret project: Flux-free time travel
- Plot hooks: Nostradan rebel groups led by Sarah; Corvus vs Tyar power struggle; blood magicians manipulating from shadows

### Notable Characters
Vera (Original Proof), Boatswain Corvus, Tyar (Benevolent Ruler), "Scoot" Sparkles, Brant the Bloody, Sarah (Gleeful Destroyer), "The Ripper", Overseer of Trials, Master of Ceremonies, Magnus Lavaborn, The Unstoppable Flow, Boof (the Champion)

## 6. PHASETIDE (Royal Blue)

> *"Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer?"*

**Existential Question**: "Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer?"

### At A Glance
- **Aliases**: The Faithful, Guardians of the One
- **Headquarters**: Cathedral-cities across the One True Timeline; Novus and Novus Secundus
- **Leaders**: The First Mother/Father (supreme theocratic leader), Zai the Final Shepherd (secret Cult leader)
- **Colors**: Royal blue, ivory, humble browns; violet (Cult)
- **Allegiances**: All other syndicates are inherently heretical; complex relationship with Singularity
- **Enemies**: Heretics (internal), Lifeblood, Silence, Splintergleam, Sungrace

### Philosophy
True believers. A dogmatic society worshipping the cycle of death, rebirth, and karma in their struggle to preserve the **One True Timeline** — which is, in truth, simply another timeline elevated to sacred status by force of belief. They embrace all aspects of existence so long as they do not disturb the prescribed arc of the Timeline, and will aggressively correct any deviance.

### Subfactions
- **Faith of the One**: Dominant theocratic body administering the One True Timeline; includes temple analysts, shatter-smiths, missionaries, inquisitors
- **Heretics**: Dissenters questioning the orthodoxy (including secret hero Khaela the Savior)
- **Cult of Finality**: **Secret death cult** hidden within Phasetide that **feeds Soval**, believing the end is divine will; founded the Faith as a vehicle for building wealth and power while inciting endless conflict

### Hierarchy
First Mother/Father → Mothers/Fathers → Grand Judges → Pontifexes → Holders/Bearers → Acolytes

### Key Locations
- **The Sanctum** — Seat of the First Mother/Father; exact location closely guarded
- **Cathedral-Cities** — Massive urban centers across the One True Timeline
- **Novus / Novus Secundus** — Major Phasetide settlements

### Flux Harvesting
Institutional scale through religious infrastructure. Thousands of Holders and Bearers perform coordinated dive operations generating Flux as religious practice — tithes of temporal energy offered to sustain the One True Timeline.

### History
Formed third among syndicates. The Cult of Finality founded the Faith of the One after witnessing Soval. Working retroactively through time, the Faith embedded its beliefs across multiple eras.

### The Great Secret
**The Cult of Finality is the true founding power behind all of Phasetide.** The Faith was created as a vehicle for the Cult to build wealth, power, and curated conflict — all ultimately feeding Soval. Some of Phasetide's highest-ranking members are Cult operatives. The Cult has contacted nihilistic elements in other syndicates.

### Secrets
- The Cult of Finality's true purpose: feeding Soval and inciting conflict
- Cross-syndicate Cult outreach to nihilistic elements in every faction
- Phasetide's secrets are hidden even from those who believe they're at the top
- Harker (Metal Reporter) may be a Singularity agent who doesn't know he's a robot

### Notable Characters
Khaela the Savior (secret heretic), Da'Kad (Heretic Crusher — "Dad'Kad"), Priestess Minia, Rift Mender Aris, The 'Stache, Dedicated Missionary, Consequence Admin Cain, Grand Judge Dhael, Pontifex Dhabu, Herald of the One, True Believer

## Faction Relationship Web

### Confirmed Alliances
- Silence ↔ Lifeblood (shared telepathic roots)
- Singularity → Lifeblood (considers ally; unrequited)
- Splintergleam ↔ Lifeblood (pragmatic cooperation)

### Confirmed Enmities
- Sungrace vs Phasetide (Phasetide doesn't reciprocate — considers itself above petty conflicts)
- Silence vs Splintergleam (Splintergleam doesn't specifically reciprocate — "all syndicates are targets")
- Lifeblood vs Singularity (nature vs technology tension)
- Phasetide vs everyone (especially Lifeblood, Silence, internal Heretics)

### Asymmetric Relationships (Intentional Design)
These one-sided enemy listings are deliberate narrative choices reflecting each faction's worldview.

## Secret Parallel Solutions (Cluster 5 — Setting's Natural Endgame)

Five syndicates are secretly working on the same problem — how to exist without feeding Soval:

1. **Lifeblood**: Growing an organism that can survive Soval
2. **Sungrace**: Building a refuge outside the timestream + a one-shot anti-entropic weapon
3. **Singularity**: Simulating simultaneous Core deactivation
4. **Silence**: Psychic dampening field to disable all Cores
5. **Splintergleam**: Flux-free time travel

**If they shared research, they might solve it. The Great Conflict prevents cooperation.** This IS the central paradox in microcosm.
