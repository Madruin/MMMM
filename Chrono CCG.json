Her Immortalization serves as Splintergleam's creation myth, the moment the syndicate's philosophy became undeniable fact. Some theorize she is not a being saved by the mountain but an emergent manifestation of Veraki itself. She speaks rarely, and when she does, Warlords fall silent. Her Immortalized form loses Temporary and gains Last Gasp: Shift to Volcanic Rivers, ensuring her influence persists even in death."

Somnus is a Whisper Network operative who has taken Silence's philosophy of isolation to its logical extreme: by eliminating all external reality, the Dreaming has become pure consciousness, existing primarily in the dream-space between timelines. Somnus may be among the most powerful telepaths in Silence, though whether the entity constitutes a functional mind or merely generates psychic resonance remains unresolved."

She is distinguished from other bounty hunters by the genuine joy she takes in the chase itself. Her abilities emphasize aggressive pursuit: Blitz and Cleave allow rapid engagement, while her Advent exposes multiple enemies at once."

Junior Lieutenant Vigo's report to Admiral Khaela identifies it as an incoming asteroid on standard instruments, indicating that it is indistinguishable from ordinary space debris on sensor readings until it acts with apparent intent. Its Divergent classification reflects its nature as something outside conventional Sungrace taxonomy."

Each incision is precisely mapped, each drop of blood recorded, and each scream catalogued as data. The rituals involve Kintsu inscription combined with controlled bloodletting to tear apertures in the temporal substrate through biological force alone, generating no Flux in the process."

The Opener is classified as Divergent, a designation for those whose power places them outside normal Splintergleam hierarchy.

Despite his fearsome nature, Odol is quoted on motivational placards throughout the Arena's training grounds, and aspirant fighters recite his words before their first bouts. He is classified as Divergent, placing him outside normal Splintergleam hierarchy. His Immortalized form gains the ability to grant Rejuvenate and trigger Flourish on allies who survive damage."

He has a well-known bond with Boof, the Champion, the Arena's famous mongrel dog."

The Tracker views conscription into Splintergleam as a form of salvation rather than condemnation. Despite Splintergleam's reputation for indiscriminate violence, its expansion depends on this kind of precision targeting. In gameplay, the Tracker uses an Activate ability that sacrifices allied resources to deal direct Core damage."

The Master of Ceremonies demonstrates that Splintergleam's violence follows a liturgy: the breaking is purposeful, not random, and someone must stand at the altar to guide the shattered toward their new form. The Immortalized version doubles down on the sacrifice-for-damage mechanic, dealing increased Core damage at a higher resource cost."

The robotic voice delivers information with flat, mechanical certainty."

Either explanation carries significant implications. A redacted conversation in the flavor text features Harker advising a younger figure that changing minds requires patience rather than proof. Harker has also raised alarms about disappearances within Phasetide, connecting the Heretic movement to the Faith's treatment of internal dissidents. Priestess Minia's references to events behind closed doors align with Harker's reporting."

No longer a single exploited person, The Strand is an amalgamated hive mind: a branching network of connected telepathy that speaks with many voices as one. The transformation inverts the original doctrine -- where the one was sacrificed for the many, now the many must die for the one to exist freely. The Council originally created The Strand as an asset, but whether it remains under Council control is a question that concerns certain operatives."

He has become a node in a network of golden power, with the Kintsu using him as a conduit to reshape terrain in real time. Reports indicate it takes an entire army to bring him to a halt, and even then the halt is temporary.

Guard, bring her to The Final Room.\" The distinction between claiming not to judge while simultaneously ordering removal to \"The Final Room\" reflects the institutional logic that the system serves the Timeline rather than the individuals who control it. Dhael is also quoted praising Pontifex Dhabu's ability to manage rebellious youth."

The ranks that once surrounded him are gone, lost to death, injury, or reassignment. He stands alone, capable only of whispering a single word: \"Brother?\" The question is not directed at anyone present but is a memory of the comrades he once had. His \"enlightenment\" is the hard-won understanding that Splintergleam's philosophy of beauty through brokenness carries a cost borne by those who believed the recruitment speeches. His final words, \"At last,\" leave ambiguous whether he seeks peace or simply surrender."

Splintergleam, for all its brutality, is the syndicate that facilitated this transformation. His hunger is not diminished but focused, and his Lost classification reflects how far beyond conventional limits the infusion has carried him.

Tyar's kingdom prospers because its ruler understands both breaking and mending and applies each with deliberate precision. In gameplay, he retains all of the Reveler's Bloodbolt generation while adding automatic resource creation each round, reflecting his expanded power base."
