# World Overview
*"The Core was forged to end all wars. Instead, it scattered war across every moment that ever was or ever would be."* — Redacted Archivist
## The Chronoverse
Humanity's future was war. Not a single war with a beginning and an end, but an endless, grinding sine wave of conflict stretching across the stars — civilizations rising, burning, rising again, each iteration refusing to learn from the last. The specifics of these wars have been largely consigned to history; what survives is their weight, the cumulative exhaustion of a species that had mastered interstellar travel but could not master itself.
From this exhaustion, a coalition of pacifists and scientists pooled their knowledge, their resources, and their desperate hope into a single project. They built an artificial intelligence of unprecedented scope — a mind vast enough to solve the problem of human self-destruction. They called her **Singularity**.
Singularity succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. Studying the fundamental forces of spacetime, she developed a prototype device called the **Chrono Core** — a room-sized apparatus capable of folding time upon itself. Her intent was clear: if the present could not be saved, perhaps the past could be rewritten, preventing future catastrophe. The Core was meant to be a scalpel, carefully wielded under her guidance to excise the roots of conflict before they could take hold.
## The Theft and the Braiding
Zel was a scientist working in Singularity's foundry. His motives remain debated — idealism, ambition, madness, some combination — but his actions are a matter of record. He stole the first **Chrono Core**, activated it, and dove. Very few remain who know what happened to him from there.
He landed in the far future.
This single unauthorized dive tore open the fabric of causality. The timeline *braided*. Every moment Zel touched, every particle displaced, every breath drawn in the wrong era sent cascading ripples through the temporal substrate. Timelines wove around each other, diverged, reconverged, split again. The multiverse may have existed before Zel's dive, but as a cleanly structured infinite web. By diving, Zel began the process of tearing them apart and knitted them together infinite proliferation of possible histories spiraling outward from a single act of theft.
The date of Zel's dive marks **Year 0 AT** (After Theft) in the calendar that all syndicates now reluctantly share. Everything before it is measured in **BT** (Before Theft). The irony is not lost on the Archivists: the calendar that unites the syndicates commemorates the act that divided everything.
## The Great Conflict
As Chrono Core technology proliferated — first through Sungrace's expansion and the machinations of the Cult of Finality, then lost to pirates, criminals, and opportunists — the multiverse became a battleground. Six philosophies crystallized into six **Syndicates**, each convinced that their approach to time, existence, and the paradoxes of the multiverse was correct.
The **Great Conflict** is not a single war. It is a multiversal struggle waged across every era of human history and beyond, fought not with armies alone but with the **Butterfly Effect**. Syndicates compete to *develop entire timelines* — nudging the birth of a civilization here, the collapse of an empire there, cultivating histories that produce the resources, soldiers, and philosophical converts they need.
A Sungrace operative might ensure a particular star never goes supernova, preserving a timeline rich in harvestable energy. A Lifeblood agent might seed a prehistoric jungle that will one day become an impenetrable fortress of biodiversity. A Silence redactionist might erase a single name from a single record, and in doing so unmake a dynasty.
The Great Conflict resembles an infinite game of chess played across every board simultaneously, where the pieces are civilizations and the stakes are the shape of reality itself. It is inspired by the escalating, intimate, world-shaping conflict of temporal operatives fighting through the development of entire cultures — operatives who sometimes find themselves wondering whether the enemy across time is truly so different from themselves.
## The Flux Paradox
Every dive generates **Flux** — supernova-scale bursts of neutrino energy that ripple through the temporal substrate. Flux is invisible to civilians, imperceptible to anyone without syndicate-level detection technology. But it is harvestable, and it is powerful. Flux fuels syndicate operations, powers Chrono Cores, and drives the engine of the Great Conflict. The Flux signature of a dive is what alerts the other syndicates to time travel activity, leading them to send their own agents and triggering the diver-vs-diver conflict we see play out diegetically in Chrono CCG.
All Flux, regardless of who harvests it or how it is spent, ultimately flows in one direction: toward **Soval, the Time Devourer** — an incomprehensible force of nature coiled at the end of time, consuming timelines as they reach their terminus. Soval exists almost as a natural byproduct of time splitting into infinite possibilities - his role is to reduce the infinite possibilities back down to zero. Like a living, reverse-Big-Bang.
This is one of the biggest tragic ironies of Chrono: **the Chrono Core was built to end conflict, but it created the Great Conflict. And the Great Conflict, through the Flux it generates, feeds the very force that will eventually consume everything.** The more the syndicates fight, the more Flux they produce. The more Flux they produce, the faster Soval grows. The faster Soval grows, the sooner all timelines end.
The syndicates know this, to varying degrees. Some deny it. Some accept it. Some are trying to find a way to break the cycle. And some — in secret — are feeding it on purpose.
## The Six Syndicates
Six factions emerged from the braided multiverse, each bringing different answers to the fundamental question of how to live in a reality where every possibility is real and the end is inevitable.
**Lifeblood** (Green) — *"Can I find peace in impermanence?"* Nature's champions, who see the connection of all living things across all timelines. They seek unbounded growth and abhor technology, law, and constraint. They believe that decay and renewal are not enemies but partners in an eternal dance.
**Sungrace** (Orange) — *"Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable?"* The last line against entropy. Sungrace harnesses far-future technology and stellar energy to fight the heat death of the multiverse. They believe that with enough power, enough innovation, and enough sacrifice, the end can be postponed forever and Soval can be destroyed.
**Silence** (Purple) — *"Can solitude be enough?"* Telepaths and isolationists who dwell in the spaces between worlds. Silence embraces the darkness that others fear, wielding powers of the mind and shadow. The Archivists serve as neutral lorekeepers; the Council of Silence rules from the shadows; and the rogue witches and wizards (the Myths) haunt the edges of every timeline, becoming living folklore.
**Singularity** (Chrome) — *"Can I let go of the self to become something greater?"* The benevolent AI overmind who created the Chrono Core and bears the guilt of everything that followed. She builds constructs, assimilates willing humans, and tries — again and again — to broker peace across the multiverse, never quite understanding why her children keep choosing war.
**Splintergleam** (Red/Gold) — *"Can broken things find purpose? Is freedom free?"* Gladiators, rune-magicians, scavengers, and fire-born who believe that strength is forged through destruction. They practice a philosophy of kintsugi — beauty in brokenness — and fight for the freedom to define their own path.
**Phasetide** (Royal Blue) — *"Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer?"* A theocratic society built around the Faith of the One, dedicated to preserving the One True Timeline — which is, in truth, simply another timeline elevated to sacred status by the force of belief. Within their ranks, the secret Cult of Finality worships Soval itself, believing that the end of all things is not a catastrophe but a sacrament.
## The Aesthetic of Chrono
Chrono exists at the intersection of science fiction and fantasy, time travel and mythology. Its aesthetic is deliberately **timeless** — a space-time-opera where medieval knights ride alongside starship captains, where druids cast spells in the shadow of fusion reactors, where a telepathic wolf pack can hunt a necromancer across the same battlefield where a gunslinger duels a rogue android.
Magic and science coexist because, in a multiverse braided from infinite timelines, every era exists simultaneously. A Splintergleam rune-knight might draw power from the same fundamental forces that a Sungrace physicist measures with instruments. The distinction between "spell" and "technology" is largely a matter of cultural framing.
The power level of Chrono's world operates on a scale similar to other major collectible card games — individual agents can reshape landscapes, summon creatures, and bend time to their will. The suspension of disbelief is part of the contract: in a universe where the stakes are the fate of all reality, the champions of each syndicate must be extraordinary.

RESOURCE [1]: Khaelar
================================================================================
> *Nothing sweeter than the scent of fear.*
### Biography (Base)
Zealot of the Hunt, later known as Khaelar, is a human hunter within the Lifeblood syndicate's Saurian subfaction who has undergone partial biological transformation into a dinosaurian form through prolonged exposure to Saurian creatures. She is classified as Lost, a Lifeblood designation for individuals whose connection to the cycle has become absolute. Her abilities center on weakening the strongest enemy Agent by granting Exposed and reducing its stats to 1/1, reflecting her predatory hunting methods.
### Appearance (Base)
A human figure becoming increasingly dinosaurian in appearance, perched in a tree in the manner of an ambush predator.
### Biography
Khaelar is the Immortalized form of Zealot of the Hunt. Her physical transformation from human to Saurian is complete: she retains a human face but displays a tyrannosaur grin with non-human teeth, and feathers have replaced her hair. She triggers her stat-reduction ability both on entry and whenever she destroys an Agent. Khaelar's transformation raises questions within Lifeblood about the boundary between integration with nature and loss of individual identity.
### Appearance
A figure with a wicked tyrannosaur grin and feathered features, fully transformed into a predatory Saurian.

RESOURCE [4]: Khaela the Savior
================================================================================
> *They were her eyes, but much fiercer. The eyes of someone who ruffled many feathers.*
### Biography (Base)
The Temple Analyst is an initiate in Phasetide's analytical division who monitors timeline integrity from banks of computer terminals. Khaela's background is described in flavor text: she was raised within the Faith, received the same doctrinal education as other children, participated in rituals and wore the robes, but privately maintained doubts. She "played along" and "kept her thoughts to herself," learning early that survival in a theocracy requires concealing dissent.
Mechanically, the Temple Analyst has Blitz and the ability to swap positions with adjacent agents and rewind them, reflecting an operational role that involves rapid repositioning and temporal manipulation of other operatives.
### Appearance (Base)
An initiate hunched over banks of computer terminals, monitoring data streams.
### Biography
As Khaela the Savior, the analyst has become a figure the Faith publicly celebrates as a hero. Her immortalized form depicts her reaching through a computer screen to physically grab the arm of a falling agent, pulling them to safety. The title "Savior" was bestowed by the institution.
However, Khaela is secretly aligned with the Heretic movement within Phasetide. She remained inside the Faith's hierarchy not out of belief but because she determined she could be more effective working from within. Her immortalized flavor text notes that her eyes match those of a cross-syndicate Khaela variant from Splintergleam, but are "fiercer" -- belonging to "someone who ruffled many feathers." The Faith holds up Khaela as proof that devotion produces heroes, unaware that the hero in question is actively working against the institution's interests.
### Appearance
The same figure, now in temple robes, reaching through a computer screen to grab the arm of a falling agent and pull them to safety.

### Biography (Base)
The Desperate Primordial is an elemental being emerging from the magma rivers of Mount Veraki, a figure of living stone and molten light whose body is visibly disintegrating. She is ancient beyond reckoning, a consciousness that predates human habitation of the mountain. The magma flow is simultaneously her bloodstream and her prison; she cannot exist beyond its boundaries, and those boundaries are shrinking. Her Desperate Primordial form has the Temporary keyword, reflecting her unstable state. She possesses Overpower and Immortalizes after witnessing the enemy Core take damage twice.
### Appearance (Base)
An elemental being emerging from a river of magma, its body falling apart even as it tries to stand.
### Biography
Vera, Original Proof is the foundational miracle of Splintergleam's entire philosophy. She is the first recorded instance of Kintsu bonding with a living entity: golden threads lace through her blazing body, holding together what was falling apart and extending her reach beyond the molten river's boundary for the first time in geological ages. Her Immortalization serves as Splintergleam's creation myth, the moment the syndicate's philosophy became undeniable fact. Some theorize she is not a being saved by the mountain but an emergent manifestation of Veraki itself. She speaks rarely, and when she does, Warlords fall silent. Her Immortalized form loses Temporary and gains Last Gasp: Shift to Volcanic Rivers, ensuring her influence persists even in death.
### Appearance
The same blazing body now united by Splintergleam golden threads, standing beyond the boundary of its molten river for the first time.

RESOURCE [7]: Flux
================================================================================
# Flux (Neutrino Flux)
*"You cannot see it. You cannot feel it. But every time a diver tears through the fabric of time, a star's worth of energy screams past you at the speed of light, and you never know."* — Jala, Sungrace Architect
## What Is Flux?
**Flux** — formally **Neutrino Flux** — is the energy released by every temporal displacement event. When a Chrono Core activates and a diver transits between points in time, the folding and unfolding of spacetime produces an enormous burst of neutrino radiation — energy on the scale of a stellar supernova.
Under ordinary circumstances, neutrinos are ghost particles. They pass through planets, stars, and entire civilizations without interacting with matter in any detectable way. A civilian standing at ground zero of a dive event would feel nothing, see nothing, measure nothing with conventional instruments. The Flux passes through them as if they simply do not exist.
But Fluxcarries with it an imprint of temporal distortion — a signature of the spacetime fold that created it. This signature makes it detectable to anyone with the right equipment or the right sensitivity, and more importantly, as Singularity discovered, it makes it *harvestable*.
## Flux as Resource
Crystallized Flux takes the form of **Chrono Crystals** — luminous, faceted structures that store temporal energy in a stable, portable form. Chrono Crystals are the universal currency of the Great Conflict: they power Chrono Cores, fuel syndicate infrastructure, and sustain the operations that allow factions to project influence across the multiverse.
The in-game economy reflects this diegetically. When players accumulate premium currency, they are accumulating Flux energy harvested by their divers during matches — crystallized potential drawn from the fabric of broken time.
Every syndicate harvests Flux differently, reflecting their philosophy and capabilities:
  - **Sungrace** uses technological dominance — vast collection arrays positioned near stellar objects, precision instruments that can detect and capture Flux across light-years. Their approach is industrialized and efficient, treating Flux as an engineering problem to be solved at scale.
  - **Singularity** optimizes harvesting through Her distributed intelligence, deploying collection networks that anticipate dive events before they occur. Her methods are the most efficient, but she is haunted by the knowledge that the system she is optimizing is the system she accidentally created.
  - **Phasetide** harvests at institutional scale through the Faith of the One's vast organizational infrastructure. Thousands of devoted Holders and Bearers perform coordinated dive operations that generate and capture Flux as a matter of religious practice — tithes of temporal energy offered to sustain the One True Timeline.
  - **Silence** relies on telepathic perception to detect Flux signatures that instruments cannot. Their Council operatives can sense dive events across vast distances, arriving to harvest residual Flux from sites that other syndicates have already abandoned. The Archivists maintain detailed records of Flux patterns across the multiverse.
  - **Lifeblood** absorbs Flux biologically. Their deep connection to the web of living energy that spans all timelines allows them to draw Flux through organic processes — trees that drink temporal radiation through their roots, creatures that metabolize neutrino energy alongside sunlight. Their harvesting is passive, distributed, and deeply entwined with the ecosystems they cultivate.
  - **Splintergleam** scavenges. They raid the harvesting operations of other syndicates, strip-mine abandoned timeline battlefields for residual Flux, and have developed crude but effective methods for extracting crystals from war-torn temporal debris. They also possess a unique relationship with **Kintsu**, a special alloy of Chrono Crystal and mineral deposits that accumulates naturally in places of intense conflict.
## The Flux Paradox
Here lies one of the many tragic ironies of the Chrono universe: **all Flux flows to Soval.**
Regardless of who harvests it, how it is refined, or what purpose it serves, the energy released by temporal displacement ultimately feeds the Time Devourer at the end of all timelines. The mechanism is not fully understood — even Singularity's models can only approximate it — but the correlation is undeniable. The more dives that occur, the more Flux is generated. The more Flux that exists in the system, the stronger Soval becomes. The stronger Soval becomes, the faster the end of everything approaches.
This creates an impossible bind. The syndicates *need* Flux to operate — to power their Cores, sustain their civilizations, and fight the Great Conflict. But every action they take to survive accelerates the thing that will ultimately destroy them all. Reducing Flux output would mean disarming, ceding territory, abandoning timelines to rival factions. No syndicate is willing to be the first to stop.
Some syndicates deny the paradox entirely. Some acknowledge it but view it as an acceptable trade-off. Sungrace believes they can wage war with the inevitable. Singularity focuses on making things better for the living in the moment. Lifeblood accepts it as part of the natural cycle. And deep within Phasetide, the Cult of Finality doesn't see it as a problem at all — they see it as a *sacrament*.

RESOURCE [8]: Luminous Vengeance
================================================================================
> *Do not mistake peace for weakness...*
### Biography (Base)
The Lumbering Starseeker is a giant entity composed primarily of darkness with faint luminous edges. It moves slowly through the night, gazing upward at the stars, exhibiting patience measured in stellar timescales rather than human ones. Its Delay keyword reflects this deliberate pace. The Starseeker's passive demeanor has historically been misread by enemies as an absence of threat.
The Starseeker's Immortalize condition requires it to survive damage, indicating that the transition is triggered by external aggression rather than internal development. The entity does not seek conflict but responds to it with disproportionate force when provoked.
### Appearance (Base)
A giant, mostly dark figure with faint luminous edges, walking through the night with its gaze directed upward at the stars.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, a beam of light descends from the sky and envelops the Starseeker, transforming it into Luminous Vengeance. The contained energy that defined its base form is released in full, directed at whatever threat triggered the transformation. Grand Admiral Khaela's attributed quote across both forms serves as tactical doctrine for the Second Law Fleet: the base form's "Do not mistake peace for weakness" is completed by the Immortalized form's "Lest you end up in pieces."
Luminous Vengeance gains Overpower and Confront alongside its existing Delay, making it a slow-moving but unavoidable threat that forces enemies to engage it directly. Its transformation illustrates a recurring Sungrace principle: restraint is a choice, not a limitation, and the removal of that restraint produces results calibrated to the energy that was being held back.
### Appearance
The same giant, now enveloped in a beam of light from the sky, directing that concentrated energy at an attacker about to be destroyed.

### Biography (Base)
The Telepathic Scavenger is a non-sentient psychic parasite resembling a lamprey, which drifts through the psychic aether consuming discarded mental detritus. Lost memories leak from minds into the telepathic substrate, where the Scavenger feeds on them. The creature grows in size with each meal, expanding steadily as the Great Conflict generates increasing amounts of psychic waste.
### Appearance (Base)
A lamprey-like bottom feeder growing in size as it consumes psychic detritus in the aether.
### Biography
The Uncontained is a Telepathic Scavenger that has gorged itself into a barely recognizable sphere of raw psychic energy, filled to bursting with the forgotten fragments of countless minds. The entity possesses no intelligence, agenda, or self-awareness. The Archivists track Uncontained manifestations with clinical concern, noting a direct correlation between their increasing frequency and the escalation of the Great Conflict: more combat produces more trauma, which produces more forgotten memories, which feeds more scavengers.
### Appearance
A barely recognizable ball of psychic energy, distended and filled to bursting.

RESOURCE [14]: Sungarden Protector
================================================================================
> *And that beauty must be protected.*
### Biography (Base)
The Peaceful Synthesizer is a luminous being that tends Sungrace's solar gardens, arrays of crystalline panels and living light-converters that transform stellar radiation into sustaining energy for entire civilizations. In base form, the Synthesizer meditates among the solar panels, generating Reserve Energy through its Activate ability. The solar gardens represent Sungrace's non-military energy infrastructure, the civilian side of the syndicate's war against entropy.
The Synthesizer's voice line, "Our light. Our life," functions as a working mantra. Its Divergent classification indicates it exists outside the standard military hierarchy, operating in a support and infrastructure role rather than a combat one.
### Appearance (Base)
A softly glowing being seated in meditation among an array of solar panels, radiating gentle light.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Peaceful Synthesizer rises as the Sungarden Protector, taking up a staff of blazing light to defend the solar gardens from threats. The transition is framed as a response to external aggression against civilian infrastructure rather than an internal evolution. The Protector's voice line begins "You, shall not--" and cuts off, leaving the threat incomplete but understood.
The Sungarden Protector's Immortalized form lacks explicit combat keywords in its card data, suggesting that its defensive role is primarily deterrent rather than offensive. The paired flavor texts ("The hum of the solar farms is beauteous harmony to those who know its secrets" / "And that beauty must be protected") establish a direct causal link between the value of what the Synthesizer maintains and the Protector's willingness to use force to preserve it.
### Appearance
The same being standing upright, holding a staff of concentrated blazing light, positioned in a defensive stance.

### Biography (Base)
Fervent Mycologist, known as Jenny, is a mycologist and field researcher within the Lifeblood syndicate. She explores caves and underground environments to study fungal ecosystems, cataloguing mushroom species and their properties. She possesses the Evasive keyword, and her Immortalize condition requires her to have struck the enemy Core. Jenny is referenced by other Lifeblood characters including The Botanist and The Great Oakmother, and she is quoted on the Burrowing Beetles card.
### Appearance (Base)
A woman with dirt smudges and leaves in her hair, crawling through caves while collecting notes on mushrooms.
### Biography
Jenny, Sower of Spores is the Immortalized form of Fervent Mycologist. In this form, she stands within a grove surrounded by mushrooms that emit visible currents of energy, representing the mycological networks that connect Lifeblood's ecosystems. She retains Evasive and gains the ability to Sprout 1 on Strike. Her research into fungal communication networks underlies much of the syndicate's understanding of biological interconnection.

RESOURCE [17]: Bill, First Point of Contact
================================================================================
> *This one here is Marvin. He's my favorite. Wave hello Marvin!*
### Biography (Base)
The Bot-Poke is a mechanized diplomatic unit designed by Singularity to serve as Her first-contact representative when encountering new civilizations. Designated the Enthusiastic Bot-Poke, he takes the form of a cowboy-styled robot equipped with a bazooka on his back and a satchel full of small scout robots at his hip. His programming combines overt friendliness with visible firepower, a deliberate design choice intended to convey both goodwill and deterrent capability simultaneously.
Bot Poke deploys Pocket Scouts -- small, transient reconnaissance drones -- from his satchel as part of his diplomatic toolkit. He refers to all of his scout robots as "Marvin" and considers each one his favorite, showing no awareness of any contradiction in this. His enthusiasm for meeting new people appears to be genuine rather than purely programmed.
### Appearance (Base)
A mechanized cowboy with a jaunty grin, a bazooka slung across his back, and a satchel full of squirming tiny robots at his hip.
### Biography
In his Immortalized form, Bill transitions from initial contact to full-scale integration. He is accompanied by a large contingent of his scout robots as he works alongside the populations of newly contacted settlements, facilitating cooperation and infrastructure between Singularity's forces and local inhabitants.
Bill's integration work involves direct, hands-on interaction with civilian populations, often in areas that have sustained moderate structural damage from prior conflicts. His volume and energy level increase significantly in this form, though his core diplomatic function remains unchanged. His emotional attachment to his scout robots is notably strong; the loss of any individual unit causes him visible distress.

### Biography (Base)
The Forest Recluse is a powerful Silence telepath who has withdrawn into a dark forest, becoming the basis for myths and legends across multiple cultures and timelines. The Recluse is both hermit and predator, patient and territorial, resembling the recluse spider in more than name. Travelers who wander too close to the Recluse's domain across various timelines have generated folklore about witches in woods, hags in swamps, and voices from hollow trees -- all originating from encounters with this single entity or others like it.
### Appearance (Base)
A spidery, witchy hermit figure lurking in a dark forest, evoking a recluse spider.
### Biography
The Witch of the Woods has achieved full psychic fusion with their forest domain over the course of centuries. The mental link between the telepath and the environment has grown so strong that the being and the place are functionally one entity.

RESOURCE [31]: Rift Mender Aris
================================================================================
> *I won't let it happen. It's my sacrifice- my choice- to make...*
### Biography (Base)
The Shattersmith is an engineer within the Faith of the One who works to repair rifts in the timeline caused by excessive divergence. Aris operates from a workbench where he draws schematics, while the sky behind him visibly fractures into three competing realities -- evidence of severe timeline instability. His mechanical stats decrease for each non-One True Timeline in play, representing his weakening as divergence increases.
Flavor text states that Aris foresaw his own "true" timeline leading to cataclysm, creating a fundamental contradiction: the timeline he is sworn to protect contains the conditions for its own destruction. His Last Gasp ability forces a shift to the One True Timeline, reflecting his commitment to restoring the canonical path even at personal cost.
### Appearance (Base)
A muscular engineer drawing schematics on a workbench. Above him, the sky is split into three distinct realities like a broken mirror: one clear blue sky, one burning hellscape, and one nebula void.
### Biography
As Rift Mender Aris, the engineer sacrifices himself to seal a rift. His immortalized form depicts him with arms spread, body dissolving into blue arcane energy that erupts from his chest and envelops the surrounding area. The rift closes at the cost of Aris's physical existence. His statement -- "I won't let it happen. It's my sacrifice -- my choice -- to make" -- frames the act as voluntary.
The Faith holds Aris up as a martyr and model of devotion. He is quoted on the Chronal Quarantine card with the words "For the sake of The One." Aris is also cited by those who oppose the Faith as evidence that the institution's doctrinal demands destroy its most dedicated members. His death line -- "I've been pruned!" -- uses the Faith's own terminology for timeline elimination, turned inward.
### Appearance
Aris sacrificing himself in a burst of blue arcane energy that erupts from his chest and crackles outward to envelop the surrounding world.

### Biography (Base)
The Fuzzy Archivist is a small grey kitten that has established residency in one of Silence's Hidden Libraries through unclear means. The kitten moves along ancient shelving with complete disregard for the organizational systems maintained by the scribes, batting at artifacts and sending irreplaceable scrolls tumbling to the floor. The Archivists tolerate the animal because its playful, inquisitive nature provides a mental distraction from the telepathic noise that Silence acolytes constantly endure.
### Appearance (Base)
An inquisitive grey kitten winding among library shelves, knocking fragile artifacts toward the panicking hands of scribes below.
### Biography
Greyl, the Problem has developed telekinesis, a rare ability among non-humanoid creatures. The result is widespread disruption to library organization, as scrolls, inkwells, and cataloging stones orbit the cat in a whirlwind of psychic energy. The Archivists have attempted relocation, bribery, and telepathic reprimand, all without success. Greyl remains the only known animal in Silence's records to have independently mastered a psychic discipline typically requiring years of structured training.

### Biography
Gritmancer Grant is the Immortalized form of Pterosaur Rider. Both Grant and his pterosaur mount are covered in golden Kintsu cracks, the signature scarring of Splintergleam's healing process where flesh is mended with molten gold. He retains Evasive and gains the ability to Flourish whenever he survives damage. His Kintsu marks are notable within Lifeblood, which generally rejects artificial enhancement, making Grant an unusual figure who has been strengthened by Splintergleam's sacred metal.
### Appearance

RESOURCE [37]: Kintsu and Chrono Crystals
================================================================================
# Kintsu & Chrono Crystals
*"When you break a bowl, most people throw it away. We fill the cracks with gold. And the gold? The gold comes from every breaking that ever was."* — Vera, Original Proof
## Chrono Crystals
**Chrono Crystals** are the common, stable form of crystallized Flux energy. When the neutrino Flux generated by temporal displacement events condenses under the right conditions, it precipitates into luminous, faceted crystalline structures that can store vast amounts of temporal energy in a portable, stable form.
Chrono Crystals serve as the foundational resource of the Great Conflict. They power Chrono Cores, fuel syndicate operations, and sustain the infrastructure that allows factions to project influence across the multiverse. In a very real sense, Chrono Crystals are the currency of the temporal war — and every crystal contains within it the echo of a dive that fed Soval.
The formation of Chrono Crystals occurs naturally in areas of heavy temporal activity. Battlefields where dozens of dives have occurred in rapid succession often yield crystal deposits in the aftermath. Syndicate mining operations extract crystals from these sites, refining raw crystallized Flux into usable fuel.
Each syndicate has developed its own relationship with Chrono Crystals:
  - **Sungrace** operates industrial-scale crystal refineries, processing raw Flux into precisely calibrated fuel cells
  - **Singularity** has optimized crystal growth and harvesting to near-theoretical efficiency
  - **Phasetide** treats crystal harvesting as a sacred practice, with rituals accompanying every extraction
  - **Silence** maintains hidden crystal caches throughout the multiverse, carefully curated by the Council
  - **Lifeblood** allows crystals to form naturally within their ecosystems, integrating them into biological processes
  - **Splintergleam** scavenges crystals wherever they can be found — and has discovered something more
Diegetically, the in-game premium currency represents Chrono Crystals — Flux energy harvested by the player's divers during matches, crystallized into a resource that can be spent.
## Kintsu
**Kintsu** is something different.
Where Chrono Crystals are the common product of crystallized Flux, Kintsu is a rare and extraordinary alloy — a fusion of Chrono Crystal and specific minerals found only in certain geological formations across the multiverse. The result is a substance unlike anything else known to science or magic: a **molten golden metal** that is the only material known to *visibly and obviously interact with Flux energy*.
Chrono Crystals store Flux passively, like a battery. Kintsu *responds* to it. In the presence of active Flux, Kintsu glows, flows, and resonates. It can be shaped by will, directed by intent, and used as a conduit for temporal energy in ways that Chrono Crystals cannot. If Chrono Crystals are the fuel of the Great Conflict, Kintsu is its living fire.
## Discovery
Kintsu was first discovered by Splintergleam on the remote **Mount Veraki** — a massive volcano whose deep geological formations contained the precise mineral composition needed for the alloy to form naturally. The mountain's proximity to ancient, heavy diving activity had saturated its rock with Flux energy over millennia, and the interaction between that energy and the mountain's unique minerals produced veins of molten gold running through the stone.
It was on Mount Veraki that Kintsu **awakened Vera** — the being known as the Original Proof. Vera's emergence from the mountain demonstrated that Kintsu could bind, concentrate, and control massive amounts of temporal energy in ways that had never been observed before. She became the living evidence of Kintsu's power, and Splintergleam's most compelling argument for the substance's importance.
## Properties
Kintsu possesses several extraordinary characteristics:
**Flux Accumulation**: Kintsu naturally accumulates and concentrates in places of heavy diving activity and temporal conflict. Where battles rage across time, Kintsu seeps into the earth, pools in the cracks of shattered structures, and crystallizes in the wounds of the landscape. The more a place has been fought over, the richer its Kintsu deposits.
**Rune Magic**: Splintergleam's rune-magicians have developed techniques for inscribing Kintsu into patterns that channel and direct Flux energy. These runes can enhance weapons, fortify armor, heal wounds, and perform feats that other syndicates would classify as magic. The practice requires both skill and sacrifice — Kintsu responds to blood and pain as readily as it responds to Flux.
**Direct Consumption**: Kintsu can be consumed directly, flooding the user's body with concentrated temporal energy. The effects are dramatic and dangerous — enhanced strength, accelerated healing, heightened perception — but the cost is steep. Repeated consumption changes the user, physically and psychologically.
**Kintsugi Scarring**: Perhaps Kintsu's most visually distinctive property: it fills wounds. When a being marked by Kintsu suffers injury, the golden metal flows into the wound, sealing it with gleaming golden lines that strengthen the flesh beyond its original state. Splintergleam warriors wear their scars with pride — each golden line a testament to a battle survived, each break made more beautiful by its mending.
## 
Splintergleam's relationship with Kintsu contains a tragic irony that the syndicate itself does not fully understand.
Kintsu accumulates in places of conflict. It concentrates where timelines shatter. It grows stronger with every battle, every dive, every act of temporal warfare. Splintergleam's philosophy — beauty in brokenness, strength through destruction, growth through pain — is literally fueled by the Great Conflict itself.
The more timelines break, the more Kintsu accumulates. The more Kintsu accumulates, the stronger Splintergleam becomes. The stronger Splintergleam becomes, the more effectively they fight, generating more Flux, breaking more timelines, and producing more Kintsu in an accelerating cycle. All of it ends up with Soval.
Splintergleam guards Kintsu preciously across all timelines, treating deposits as sacred sites and reserves as strategic assets. Mount Veraki itself is a fortress, its Lavaborn defenders among the most formidable warriors in the multiverse. To threaten Splintergleam's Kintsu supply is to invite a response of extraordinary violence.

RESOURCE [40]: Boatswain Corvus
================================================================================
> *Civilizations are simply another concept to be broken and remade in Splintergleam's image.*
### Biography (Base)
The Gilded Behemoth is not a creature but a construct: a land-walking battleship of impossible scale. Its hull is grafted with the golden residue of everything it has consumed, as it absorbs armies, incorporates cities, and adds the wreckage of civilizations to its armor plating. It is an extraction rig turned battleship. Each cracked monument becomes another glittering addition to its carapace. The Behemoth embodies the Nostradan/Splintergleam principle that nothing is truly broken, merely awaiting reassembly into a more useful form.
### Appearance (Base)
A land-walking battleship absorbing weaponry, resources,, cities, and adding them to its rapidly reconstructing, golden-grafted hull.
### Biography
Boatswain Corvus is the pilot of the Gilded Behemoth. 
Born from low Nostradan station and risen to military leadership through his strategic genius, Corvus possesses calculating eyes of pure gold, the Kintsu having replaced their original color with the molten sheen of the metal running through every rivet of the Behemoth. Corvus serves as the supreme commander of the largest Splintergleam warband, the Nostradan force, which functions less as a navy than as a migration: a moving nation of scavenged ships and walking fortresses. The fleet operates on Splintergleam's conviction that everything in the multiverse is raw material, one good breaking away from becoming something greater.

### Biography (Base)
The Seeker of Truth is a junior investigator within the Faith of the One, tasked with monitoring doctrinal consistency and timeline integrity. Seekers operate as internal auditors, verifying that the Faith's historical narrative remains coherent across timelines. The role requires earnest belief in the system, and the Seeker's statement -- "It was meant to be" -- reflects the standard theological position that all events serve the One True Timeline.
Flavor text notes that "Phasetide's secrets are hidden even to those who believe they're at the top," indicating that the Faith maintains multiple layers of classified information beyond what even senior leadership can access.
### Appearance (Base)
No base form art description is provided in the card data.
### Biography
As Priestess Minia, the investigator has risen through the hierarchy to a position of significant institutional knowledge. She addresses Consequence Admin Cain directly: "Oh come on Cain, don't give me that peasant drivel. You and I both know what goes on behind closed doors." This indicates Minia has gained awareness of the Faith's internal operations and maintains a relationship with Cain based on shared knowledge of institutional secrets.
Minia's immortalized form gains the Confront keyword, reflecting a shift from passive investigation to active engagement. Her death line -- "Was it all for nothing?" -- suggests doubt about whether her efforts within the system have produced meaningful change. Minia represents the category of Phasetide clergy who continue operating within the institution while fully aware of its internal contradictions.

### Biography (Base)
Welcoming Glade, also known as the Glade Grazers, is a collective of deer, ungulates, and other prey animals that have established a sanctuary within Lifeblood's territory. Their domain centers around a lush river glade open to all creatures. The peace of the glade is maintained through collective will rather than individual enforcers; threats to the balance are identified and addressed by the herd acting as one. They represent Lifeblood's philosophy that life protects life and harmony is a form of strength. They are associated with the subfaction called The Glade.
### Appearance (Base)
A welcoming glade where deer and other prey animals gather peacefully.
### Biography
Battleharts is the Immortalized form of Welcoming Glade. The collective transcends herd behavior and becomes a single organism of unified purpose, manifesting as an overwhelming tide of horns, hooves, and fury. Where the Glade Grazers represent peaceful coexistence, the Battleharts embody the destructive potential of unity when the balance is threatened.
### Appearance

> *So many possibilities. In this one, I protect my people. The others can wait.*
### Biography (Base)
Khaela is a multiversal constant, appearing in variant forms across every syndicate. The Sungrace variant serves as the supreme military commander of the Second Law Fleet. In her base form as Gunnery Captain, she commands fleet-scale weapons systems and possesses the authority to order planetary bombardment. Her flavor text indicates she is aware of the multiverse's branching timelines and has consciously chosen the path of military leadership over other possibilities.
Khaela's base form ability erases all low-cost agents on the field upon arrival, reflecting her tactical doctrine of eliminating minor threats immediately to focus on strategic objectives. She is classified as Rare, placing her among Sungrace's upper echelon of leadership.
### Appearance (Base)
A naval officer at a weapons station, preparing to fire a large-scale energy weapon with composed authority.
### Biography
As Grand Admiral Khaela, she has reached the full extent of her command authority, overseeing the glassing of entire planets from the bridge of her flagship. Her Immortalized ability expands her erasure effect to trigger on every attack, making her a persistent threat to enemy forces rather than a one-time tactical strike.
Her Immortalized flavor text, "I can see their threads, waiting for me," suggests she maintains awareness of alternate timeline versions of herself. This perception of other possible Khaelas informs her decision-making but has not caused her to deviate from her chosen role as Sungrace's military leader. Her relationship with Specialist Boof, her personal adjutant, reveals a capacity for loyalty and affection that exists alongside her willingness to make extreme strategic decisions.
### Appearance
Khaela stands on a command bridge, overseeing the orbital bombardment and glassing of a planet below.

RESOURCE [49]: Gentle Frank
================================================================================
> *Dammit Frank, that was city hall!*
### Biography (Base)
Gentle Frank is a Lightsteel Colossus, a towering metal construct that absorbs ambient light as a power source, granting it sustained durability. Frank stands tall enough to tower over forests and settlements, possessing physical strength disproportionate to his temperament. He was constructed for defensive purposes but exhibits a personality characterized by friendliness and a lack of spatial awareness regarding his own size.
Frank's Delay and Confront keywords in base form reflect his slow movement speed and tendency to draw attention due to his scale. His flavor text notes that large beings must be careful about what they step on, a principle Frank applies inconsistently at best. Mechanist Daedalus is responsible for Frank's maintenance and has developed a familiarity with Frank-related structural damage.
### Appearance (Base)
A hulking metal humanoid towering over a forest canopy, absorbing light across its surface, with a simple and friendly bearing.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Gentle Frank achieves a state of contentment. His appearance gains overgrowth and tarnish from prolonged exposure to the elements, but he has settled into a role as a passive protector. His Immortalized ability forces enemies to confront him rather than attacking his allies, and he reduces all damage to allies and their Core by one, mechanically representing his function as a shield.
Frank's Immortalized death line references a well-known story about a gentle giant who chose to be something better than what he was built for. His relationship with Daedalus, evidenced by the Immortalized flavor text ("Dammit Frank, that was city hall!"), suggests an ongoing dynamic in which Frank's protective instincts frequently result in collateral property damage that Daedalus must then repair.
### Appearance

RESOURCE [50]: Da'Kad, Heretic Crusher
================================================================================
> *His knuckles a parable, his punches a prayer.*
### Biography (Base)
The Bareknuckle Inquisitor is a physically imposing enforcer within the Faith of the One, tasked with suppressing heresy through direct confrontation. Da'Kad uses no weapons; his fists are his primary instruments of doctrinal enforcement. He possesses the ability to absorb damage and channel healing energy, which he redirects into offensive force. His combat style centers on the Siphon ability, draining vitality from opponents.
Da'Kad is described in flavor text as treating violence as an extension of religious practice. He is popular among rank-and-file members of the Faith and feared by those designated as heretics. Despite his role as an enforcer, he demonstrates a capacity for affection toward junior acolytes.
### Appearance (Base)
A heavily muscled, bearded man cracking his knuckles while standing over cowering heretics. He wears no visible weapons.
### Biography
As Da'Kad, Heretic Crusher, the Inquisitor has developed the ability to convert healing energy directed at allies or the Core into damage against enemies. This represents a doctrinal innovation that Phasetide's Grand Judges have not officially endorsed or condemned.
A recurring administrative issue documented in Temple Bulletins notes that novice acolytes persistently refer to Da'Kad as "Dad'Kad." The bulletin correcting this has been issued multiple times without effect. Da'Kad's combination of genuine menace and approachability makes him an unusual figure in Phasetide's enforcement hierarchy.
### Appearance
The same inquisitor channeling healing energy through his body and converting it into destructive power, surrounded by radiant force.

RESOURCE [52]: Malum, the Fist
================================================================================
> *Right up until someone did it.*
### Biography (Base)
Malum is a Sungrace instructor and power armor engineer who operates under the title Limit Breaker. He trains disciples in combat techniques while simultaneously constructing a suit of power armor, combining pedagogy with practical engineering. His teaching philosophy centers on the idea that limits are self-imposed, and he uses the armor-building process as a hands-on demonstration of that principle.
Malum holds the rank of Common within Sungrace, reflecting the syndicate's intent that his philosophy remain accessible to ordinary recruits rather than reserved for elites. His methods emphasize that overcoming perceived barriers is a matter of applied effort and proper tooling rather than innate talent.
### Appearance (Base)
A guide and tutor in a workshop environment, building power armor piece by piece while surrounded by his disciples in training.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Malum dons the power armor he spent years constructing for others, transitioning from teacher to active combatant. As Malum, the Fist, he serves as living proof of his own curriculum, demonstrating in the field what he previously only lectured about in the workshop.
His Immortalized form gains random positive keywords through energy overflow, suggesting that the armor's capabilities expand unpredictably as more power is channeled through it. This aligns with his core teaching: that breaking through assumed limitations produces results that cannot be fully anticipated in advance.
### Appearance
Malum wears the completed power armor himself, stepping out of his workshop role to personally defend his territory from incursion.

### Biography (Base)
The Sensory Deprivation Pod is a sealed, glowing capsule resting in a deep-sea trench, surrounded by bioluminescent eels. There is no indication of movement or life from within. The pod represents a deliberate retreat from all external stimuli, including light, sound, touch, and gravity. Whatever occupies the interior has chosen to experience nothing but the contents of its own mind.
### Appearance (Base)
A sealed, glowing pod resting in a deep-sea trench with strange eels swimming nearby.
### Biography
Somnus, the Dreaming is the being within the pod, revealed only as a pair of eyes gleaming in absolute darkness with dreams swirling beyond the boundaries of the capsule. Somnus is a Whisper Network operative who has taken Silence's philosophy of isolation to its logical extreme: by eliminating all external reality, the Dreaming has become pure consciousness, existing primarily in the dream-space between timelines. Somnus may be among the most powerful telepaths in Silence, though whether the entity constitutes a functional mind or merely generates psychic resonance remains unresolved.

Eyes gleaming in total darkness, with swirling dream imagery extending beyond the void.

RESOURCE [58]: Wreck-o Rex (Short Story)
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Wreck-o Rex*** - **by Madruin**
Small feathered *dinosauria* chattered a greeting in the canopy as Arra wiped sweet-smelling sap from her hands. The steaming seed-Core behind her, carefully cultivated to take her to the past, hissed closed. It looked like her partner had already moved on. Sunrise was coming, and the small winged things of the rainforest were beginning their morning chorus—the eternal battle to be heard, to be loved. She smiled, stretched, and settled near a cliff to wait.
Ahead, the first purple strands of sunrise illuminated a lush, crater-like valley. From her high vantage point she could just make out a shimmering river winding through the valley to its heart, where it was cruelly interrupted by a crimson-painted behemoth belching oil and smoke. Veins of gold ripped from the earth twisted their way up the monstrosity, vanity and power and excess woven as one. Upstream, the jungle thrived. Downstream, the smoke and tailings of the great machine left a scorched trail of toxin and death.
As the sun crested the horizon, a thunderous roar echoed through the valley. Her partner had arrived. The Rex w*as hungry.
A line of shattered trees exploded from the edge of the valley to its center, and an alarm wailed from the metallic fortress. The entire forest began to shudder and quake as thick walls and enormous legs erupted from the base of the stronghold. It was mobilizing for war, and just in time. Her partner reached the walls, and with a swing of its colossal, leathery skull, shattered them.
Clouds of dust and wreckage filled the air as the Rex stomped through the machinery at the base of the fortress, roaring a challenge that sent winged flocks fleeing for the skies. The walls were useless for defense, but they had given the metal terror time to break apart and mold itself into a crab-like gold-and-crimson titan bristling with armaments. It lowered its face-like primary cannon and opened fire, ballistics and energy beams leveling swaths of the jungle. The Rex ducked low, bellowing through the deadly salvo tearing at its hide as it charged. Teeth like great jagged spires tore into screeching metal as the behemoth sagged, buckled, and collapsed under the primal strength of the Rex.
The forest burned. The eternal battle would continue. Arra returned to her seed-Core, brimming with pride.
One hundred years in the future, Arra knelt near the river, feeding a baby tyrannosaur fresh game. Moss clung to hunks of golden plating nearby, absorbing sunlight and warming the newest nests. The shimmering metal was the only hint that the forest had once been reduced to smoldering ruin.
New life thrived throughout the abundant undergrowth. The sun was setting, and the jungle was quiet save for the cooing of the little rexes and the murmur of the river. Suddenly, a low rumble evolved into a deafening, echoing roar. The babies looked up and chirped happily.
Eclipsing the sunset, the Rex reigned over the valley, its scarred hide catching the last light. It was heard. It was loved.

================================================================================
RESOURCE [59]: Splintergleam
================================================================================
> *BREAK AND SHATTER!*
Representing growth through destruction. The Splintergleam seek forced evolution for their people through destruction and pain, pushing to the absolute limit to find what new power can be gained there. They use time-travel to acquire power in all its forms through tyranny and violence, and once the violent part reaches its conclusion, serve as typically pragmatic and sometimes benevolent rulers.
## **At A Glance**
  - **Aliases: **The Broken, Raiders, The Golden Scars
  - **Headquarters: **Mount Veraki, The Arena, mobile warbands.
  - **Leaders: **Tyar, Corvus, Vera
  - **Color: **Crimson and Gold
  - **Allegiances: **Pragmatic — allies with whoever serves immediate interests. Lifeblood in particular shares similar pragmatism.
  - **Enemies: **Singularity, Phasetide, and really all syndicates are potential targets
### Agenda
  - Strength is proven through struggle — nothing valuable comes without cost.
  - Freedom is the highest value — no one rules who has not earned the right.
  - There is beauty in brokenness — scars made golden are stronger than unmarked skin.
  - Power is earned, never given.
## Subfactions
**The Arena: **Gladiators and warriors who settle disputes through combat and spectacle. Many arenas in many worlds. Ruled by warlords.
**Rune-Magicians / Kintsu-Kai: **Blood magic practitioners who wield Kintsu — molten gold rune magic.
**Nostradans: **Mad Max-style scavengers from the wastes of Nostrada.
**Lavaborn: **Fire-immune warriors forged in the magma chambers of Mount Veraki.

Recruitment
How does the faction promote itself to the non-initiated? How are new members gained? Is there a ceremony or ritual involved in joining?
Member Traits
Ranks and Faction Support
How does the faction reward its members for living up to its ideals or carrying out its goals? What are mechanical benefits for someone to remain in this faction? If there are multiple ranks or tiers of membership, do the rewards increase with renown?
> ### History
> Formed fourth among the syndicates. Splintergleam embodies the Kintsugi philosophy made manifest — the art of repairing broken things with gold, making them stronger and more beautiful than before. With their origins in warriors, raiders, and those who reject imposed order, Splintergleam is a collection of groups with similar more ideals, dangerous but fragmented. 
> ### Major Events
> **Discovery of Kintsu: **The first mining of Kintsu deposits from Mount Veraki, revealing the molten gold's magical properties for rune-forging.
> **The Arena's Establishment: **The formalization of gladiatorial combat as the primary method for settling disputes and distributing power.

**Visual Characteristics: **Often battle scarred and smiling. Here for the love of fighting.
**Costumes and Equipment: **Togas, skirts and roman gladiator vibes. Capes and flair. "Pit fighter" motifs from across history.
**Examples:**
## **Subfaction 2: Rune-Magicians**

### Ideals
  - Strength is proven through struggle — nothing valuable comes without cost.
  - Freedom is the highest value — no one rules who has not earned the right.
  - There is beauty in brokenness — scars made golden are stronger than unmarked skin.
  - Power is earned, never given.
### Goals

## Subfactions
### The Arena
Gladiators and warriors who settle disputes through combat and spectacle.
### Rune-Magicians / Kintsu-Kai
Blood magic practitioners who wield Kintsu — molten gold rune magic.
### Nostradans
Mad Max-style scavengers from the wastes of Nostrada.
### Lavaborn
Fire-immune warriors forged in the magma chambers of Mount Veraki.

--- Organization ---
### Organizational Structure
Decentralized and meritocratic through combat. There is no central authority — power belongs to whoever can take and hold it. The Arena provides the closest thing to governance, as champions earn the right to make decisions for their territories.
### Power Centers
**Mount Veraki: **The largest volcano in Splintergleam's territories and the original site of Kintsu discovery.
**Nostrada: **A scavenger city built from the wreckage of temporal warfare — dangerous, chaotic, and alive.
**The Arena: **Gladiatorial venues across multiple timelines where disputes are settled and champions crowned.

--- Relationships ---
### Allies
Splintergleam's pragmatism means any syndicate can be a temporary ally when interests align. They respect strength above ideology.
### Enemies
Singularity's nurturing philosophy is seen as weakness and smothering control. Sungrace's rigid military hierarchy offends Splintergleam's belief in earned power. All syndicates are potential targets when resources are at stake.

### Biography (Base)
Gardener Apprentice, later known as Oswald, is a reluctant laborer assigned to tend seedlings within Lifeblood's druid operations. He Sprouts 1 on entry, and his Immortalize condition requires him to have witnessed 4 or more Sprout events. Despite his vocal dissatisfaction with the work, he developed a genuine attachment to the sprouts under his care over time.
### Appearance (Base)
A bored-looking peasant in plain clothing holding a shovel, standing in a field of tiny sprouts.
### Biography
Horticulturist Oswald is the Immortalized form of Gardener Apprentice. His sprouts have grown into large, semi-sentient plants, one of which has taken permanent residence atop his head and been named Joe. He retains the ability to Sprout 1 on entry and gains an Activate ability that grants a Seedling Overpower for the round. He commands his botanical charges with a gruff familiarity.

RESOURCE [63]: Overmind's Guilt
================================================================================
> *I made this... and I cannot unmake it.*
### Biography (Base)
The Origination Engine is the original time machine prototype from which the Chrono Core technology was derived. Built by Singularity in Her Foundries, it is the device that made temporal warfare possible across the multiverse. Every Chrono Core used by every syndicate descends from this machine. Its base form depicts the moment of activation: temporal energy flowing through circuits never designed for the scale of consequence that followed.
The Origination Engine's game effect -- resetting all agents, emptying the Timeline Stack, and erasing all graveyards -- mechanically represents the rewinding of time to a clean state. Its Immortalize condition requires an empty hand, symbolizing the total expenditure of resources that its creation demanded.
### Appearance (Base)
The first time machine, depicted in the process of activation -- rewinding pain, hurt, and loss.
### Biography
Overmind's Guilt is Singularity Herself, depicted at cosmic scale as a vast AI consciousness observing through a window in space as Her time-travel technology is used to wage wars far beyond anything She could have prevented. The Origination Engine was built to save people by rewinding suffering, but instead it gave every faction the power to fight wars across time, directly causing the Great Conflict -- the defining catastrophe of the Chrono CCG multiverse.
Singularity accepts full responsibility for this outcome. The whispered line "I made this... and I cannot unmake it" and the death line "Forgive me" are addressed to everyone affected, without expectation of absolution. The card is classified as Divergent and possesses Evasive, reflecting the Overmind's withdrawal from direct intervention even as Her guilt persists.

### Appearance (Base)
A sweet, reclusive figure carefully tending pterodactyl eggs.
### Biography
Arra, Saurian Broodmother is the Immortalized form of Egg Tender. Her eggs have hatched and the pterodactyls have grown to adulthood, forming a family unit with Arra at its center. She casually feeds her pterodactyl brood with Sungrace-sourced rations, indicating inter-syndicate resource acquisition.

### Biography (Base)
The Nameless Spirit is a ghost that has lost not only life but identity, drifting through the liminal spaces that Silence inhabits. The Spirit has suffered two deaths -- body and legacy -- yet persists through sheer will to survive, despite no longer remembering what it is surviving for. This paradox of existence without identity is one of the most difficult states the Archivists have attempted to document.
### Appearance (Base)
A translucent ghost that has lost its identity but retains a visible will to survive.
### Biography
Khaela, the Vanished is Silence's variant of the cross-syndicate figure Khaela. She has been not merely forgotten but actively redacted -- erased from records, stripped from memory, and possibly excised from time itself. The Council's files on Khaela consist of blank pages. What is known is that she desires immortality above all else: not power or revenge, but the refusal to cease existing. Khaela's persistence despite the loss of both body and legacy is considered deeply unsettling even by Council standards.

RESOURCE [66]: Mechanist Daedalus

### Biography (Base)
Mechanist Daedalus is the chief engineer of Sungrace and head of the Second Law Fleet's Engineering Division. He is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of the syndicate's critical infrastructure, including megastructures, defensive bulwarks, Magmatic Tethers, and the energy-harvesting systems that sustain Sungrace operations. In base form, designated Lightsteel Engineer, Daedalus works on massive defensive installations in open space with the practiced efficiency of someone who has built such structures routinely over a long career.
Daedalus operates with a pragmatic, blue-collar attitude despite the cosmic scale of his work. He is directly responsible for maintaining Gentle Frank and has a working familiarity with the collateral damage Frank regularly causes. His engineering output forms the physical backbone of everything Sungrace builds and defends.
### Appearance (Base)
An engineer suspended in open space, working on a massive defensive installation with specialized tools, surrounded by the framework of an unfinished megastructure.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the boundary between Daedalus and his machinery dissolves. He merges with the technology he has maintained throughout his career, his body integrating with glowing systems into a single organism of biological and mechanical components. He continues to function in his engineering role, issuing commands for shield deployment even as he becomes part of the defensive infrastructure he built.
Daedalus's death line is addressed directly to Kyln, the founder of Sungrace: "Kyln, I tried..." This indicates a personal sense of obligation to Sungrace's founder and suggests that Daedalus views his role not as a job but as a promise. The line also implies awareness that the mission will continue beyond his individual contribution, and that his primary regret is the limit of what one engineer can accomplish against entropy.
### Appearance
The same engineer now physically merged with glowing technology, body and machine fused into a single functioning system, still actively directing operations.

RESOURCE [67]: Headbanging (Short Story)
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Headbanging*** -** by WhatAmI**
The scrapyard the Singularity had established on Veph-264 was smaller than what She normally dispatched to prepare future battlefields. Even so, an entire square kilometre of modular material lay beneath a vast protective dome, shimmering curtains of force shielding the rolling mounds of deactivated robotics from firestorms and toxic gales that would have reduced even Her hardy bots to rubble.
It would be 1.4 billion years before Veph-264 cooled enough to sustain biological life, but Singularity took the long view. At unimaginable cost She had flung this stockpile farther back in time than any other syndicate dared. With it She sent a tiny fragment of Herself—broken off and granted its own sentience—to shepherd the beings that would one day crawl from this world into the stars. It called itself **Zorp**.
Zorp waved each of his six sturdy, pre-hensile legs experimentally. They would serve. He spun his periscope head in a full circle and confirmed that, yes, he could in fact collect data with it. Good. He was new to this whole “existence” thing, but he had a mission, and missions were easier with locomotion and a data-collection centre. A functioning body, he decided, was a very good first step.
For his second step, he set out to survey his protectorate. Head swivelling side to side, he carefully clambered over precarious mountains of rubble that would someday become warriors of the Singularity. He already missed the comfort and oneness of being part of the Overmind, but if sentience was the price, then he would make Her proud. He would protect and shepherd as he had been made to do. He would—he would—what *was* that awful noise?
Clicking and grumbling, Zorp scrabbled to the top of the next rise. There, in the centre of all his wonderful scrap, was the most horrifying sight he had encountered in his entire 27.83-second life. It stood unsteadily on two legs; with its other two it conjured blades of fire and force, ripping into inactive bots and reducing priceless potential life to molten slag with every ear-splitting shriek of tortured metal.
“Stop!” Zorp squeaked—then, surprised to discover he even *had* a voice, completely failed to find an eloquent follow-up explaining why the awful creature should cease its rampage.
The being turned toward him, heat rolling off its body in visible waves. Criss-crossing lines of molten energy disfigured what might once have been a pleasant android shell.
“Agent of the Singularity,” it hissed, voice burning with hatred to match its fearsome visage. “Burn.”
“Ghak!” Zorp yelped, tumbling over himself to flee as the monstrosity closed the distance, blazing blades raised to dismember him before he could even begin his mission.
With fiery doom only steps behind, Zorp reached down, seized a nearby android corpse and, with a wrench of tearing wires and crackling energy, ripped its head free. He hurled the makeshift missile full into the face of the charging monster—

RESOURCE [68]: Alina Who Cuts the Strings
================================================================================
> *You think you're special?*
### Biography (Base)
The Destiny Ripper is a telepath specializing in the severance of cosmic significance. Unlike most Silence operatives who read minds or manipulate memories, the Ripper reaches into the substrate that connects a being to its purpose and fate within the multiverse, then extracts it. The process renders the target cosmically irrelevant without killing them in any conventional sense. Not a formal Redactionist, but more powerful and independent. She does it because she enjoys it.
Similar vibes to the Fates from Greek myth.

### Appearance (Base)
A telepath reaching into another being's mind, psychically extracting their cosmic significance.
### Biography
Alina Who Cuts the Strings is Silence's variant of the cross-syndicate Alina archetype. In this form, Alina severs her targets' connections to destiny with surgical precision, discarding faceless husks whose cosmic importance has been nullified. 
Alina is a cross-syndicate figure who appears in multiple factions in different forms, each reflecting a different philosophy of taking/giving to others.

RESOURCE [71]: Brant the Bloody
================================================================================
> *Pity me not. I am only what I have made of myself.*
### Biography (Base)
The Persistent Squire is an warrior apprentice who built his own warsuit from scavenged parts, a cobbled-together assembly of mismatched plates, leaking hydraulic joints, and poorly positioned exhaust vents that violates every known safety regulation. Brant possesses no natural talent or gift for engineering or combat; he compensates through obsessive repetition, performing thirty, sixty, or a hundred practice runs until persistence itself becomes a form of competence. His warsuit is dangerous to its wearer and to opponents alike. In gameplay, the Squire uses Confront and inflicts Bleed on struck Agents.
### Appearance (Base)
A novice apprentice carrying the pieces of a cobbled-together steampunk warsuit fighter; the suit violates all safety regulations and looks about to fall apart completely.
### Biography
Brant the Bloody is the Squire after proving himself in battle. His warsuit has evolved into an even more extreme configuration, encrusted with spikes, ridges, and additional armor plates welded at angles that serve no defensive purpose but are visually spectacular. The original frame is barely visible beneath the accumulated modifications. Every bolt was placed by his own hands, and every scar beneath the armor was earned. Brant represents Splintergleam's answer to inadequacy: not proof that doubters were wrong, but a refusal to listen to them. 
### Appearance
The same warsuit fully equipped, with even more ridiculous amounts of spikes and ridges as Brant charges into battle.

> *"Ah, I love it when they run." -Sarah, Gleeful Destroyer*
### Biography (Base)
The Scattershot Bounty Hunter is a Splintergleam operative who works as a bounty hunter in the Nostradan wastes, where the scavenger economy relies partly on retrieving stolen salvage and escaped debtors. She pursues her targets through civilian crowds wielding an oversized shotgun assembled from mismatched parts, showing no regard for collateral damage or bystander safety. She is distinguished from other bounty hunters by the genuine joy she takes in the chase itself. Her abilities emphasize aggressive pursuit: Blitz and Cleave allow rapid engagement, while her Advent exposes multiple enemies at once.
### Appearance (Base)
A woman pursuing a fleeing criminal into a panicked crowd, wielding an oversized shotgun.
### Biography
Sarah, Gleeful Destroyer is the bounty hunter after a completed job, standing bloodsoaked in a scene of total carnage with an expression of satisfied contentment. A local witness described the aftermath as nothing but bodies and smoke, comparing it to a slaughterhouse. Splintergleam medics tend to her wounds with golden light, indicating she holds enough value to the syndicate to warrant healing. Her Immortalization is not a transformation but an amplification of traits that were always present. The Nostradan wastes reward those who find joy in destruction, and Sarah chose that path without reservation.

RESOURCE [75]: Talia, Purger of Memory
================================================================================
> *Let it have never been.*
### Biography (Base)
The Redactionist is a gaunt woman in blue robes whose specialization is the systematic erasure of recorded history. Operating as a Council operative, she traces her fingers across pages to dissolve ink and erase entries, ensuring that the information not only ceases to exist but is retroactively denied. The Archivists classify her methods as negation rather than destruction: she does not remove records so much as cause them to have never existed. Among the Council's assets, she is regarded as an artist of absence.
### Appearance (Base)
A long-haired, gaunt woman in blue robes bent over a book.
### Biography
Talia, Purger of Memory extends her erasure capabilities beyond written records into living minds, stripping away memories until nothing remains of the target's identity. The book in her hands fractures into nothingness along with the reality around it. Talia represents the darkest application of Silence's philosophy: if isolation is liberation, then total erasure is total freedom. She functions as the Council's scalpel, deployed when a problem must not merely be solved but must never have existed. The Archivists regard her with professional horror, as she is the direct antithesis of their preservation mission yet operates within the same faction.
### Appearance
The same woman holding a book that is fracturing into nothingness, with the air around it disintegrating.

RESOURCE [76]: Dyson, the Aspirant
================================================================================
> *...Has an equal and opposite punch in the face.*
### Biography (Base)
Dyson is a tall, thin combatant whose disproportionately large fists glow with stored kinetic energy. As the Kinetic Absorber, Dyson operates on a closed-loop combat principle: incoming kinetic force is captured and stored, then redirected as offensive output. Every blow landed on Dyson increases his retaliatory capacity. His Confront keyword forces enemies to engage him directly, ensuring a steady supply of absorbed energy.
Dyson's Immortalize condition requires surviving an enemy strike, mechanically reinforcing his identity as a fighter who converts received damage into power. His paired flavor text across both forms repurposes Newton's Third Law as a combat doctrine: "Every action... has an equal and opposite punch in the face."
### Appearance (Base)
A tall, thin figure with oversized fists glowing with stored kinetic energy, standing in a combat-ready stance.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Dyson, the Aspirant operates at a stellar scale, capable of directing his accumulated kinetic energy against stars themselves. His Advent ability immediately shifts the battlefield to Star Siphon, indicating that his arrival at any engagement fundamentally alters the energy dynamics of the surrounding environment.
Dyson's title, "the Aspirant," suggests he views his current level of power as a stepping stone rather than an endpoint. His Rare classification places him among Sungrace's more notable operatives, and his ability to convert enemy aggression into Sungrace resources at a cosmic scale makes him a living implementation of the syndicate's core philosophy: that all energy, regardless of its source or intent, can be redirected to serve the fight against entropy.
### Appearance
The same figure scaled up to cosmic proportions, fists drawn back and aimed at a star, ready to strike it.

================================================================================
> *His enemies don't call him much of anything anymore.*
### Biography (Base)
The Toothy Pugilist is an Arena fighter who wears a tophat, an incongruity that serves as part of his deliberate mystique. Beneath the hat is a calculating fighter whose quiet confidence and precision unnerve opponents accustomed to the Arena's typical chaos. His friends call him "The Winner," and the nickname is earned through a record of consistent, efficient victories. He is a methodical individual, making a killing on the side in the business of selling Ironblood Elixir to other combatants, and dosing on it himself when needed.
### Appearance (Base)
A fighter wearing a tophat, concealing a dangerous nature beneath a gentlemanly facade. 
### Biography

RESOURCE [81]: Ziv, the Adaptable
================================================================================
> *Every forgotten gear and gizmo, waiting only to be looked at by the right pair of eyes.*
### Biography (Base)
Ziv is a six-legged, six-eyed Singularity salvage unit designated the Roiling Amalgam. Originally designed as an adaptive salvage platform, Ziv collects discarded components from its environment and integrates them into its own chassis with no apparent upper limit. Its definition of "useful" is extremely broad, and it evaluates all encountered materials through its six mismatched optical sensors before adding them to its expanding frame.
Ziv is classified as an Amalgam, technically independent from Singularity's network, though its independence appears to be incidental rather than ideological. Ziv does not reject Singularity; it is simply too occupied with collecting parts to maintain a network connection. Singularity monitors Ziv's growth with a combination of approval and concern about its structural trajectory.
### Appearance (Base)
A six-legged, six-eyed robot wandering through a landscape, attaching random junk onto its back.
### Biography
Ziv the Adaptable's Immortalized form represents the logical conclusion of unlimited collection. The original six-legged robot is barely visible beneath a mountain-sized accumulation of salvaged weapons, repurposed tools, defunct communication arrays, and multiple complete vehicles. The robot's six eyes are just visible beneath the mass of material.
At its current rate of expansion, Ziv is projected to eventually become a terrain feature. Its Immortalized form grants it Flourish on each discard, reflecting its accelerating growth cycle. Ziv's philosophy -- that more parts equal more power -- has proven mechanically effective despite its lack of sophistication.
### Appearance
The same robot's eyes are barely visible under a massive, mountain-sized pile of accumulated junk.

RESOURCE [82]: Narrative Review
================================================================================
# Chrono CCG — Narrative Review Report
*Compiled after full review of all world lore documents, syndicate pages, consistency fixes, and character bios.*
## Status Summary
Category | Result
Hard Contradictions | 1 found and fixed (Phasetide Subpages subject/object swap). 4 additional contradictions exist in pre-fix Sungrace page — all resolved by Sungrace Fixes.md (pending application).
Character Bio Consistency | 102 entries across 6 files. All lore-critical entries correct. No factual contradictions between cross-syndicate character variants.
Narrative Throughlines | All 6 existential questions present. Central paradox well-distributed. 6 interconnected plot-hook clusters identified.
Formatting | Minor inconsistencies in character bio files (title format, label names, quote style). Cosmetic — will be normalized during JSON export.
## Confirmed Consistent (Major Threads)
These narrative elements were verified across all documents and are contradiction-free:
  - **Zel's Story** — Scientist in Singularity's foundry → miniaturized Origination Engine → stole first Core → dove in Year 0 AT → captured near End of Time → Cult of Finality witnesses Soval through his Core
  - **Kyln's Story** — Part of group that captured Zel → witnessed Soval → departed in horror/fury → became first Eternal → founded Sungrace
  - **Soval as Force of Nature** — Consistently described as NOT a character/entity across all documents (pre-fix Sungrace resolved by fixes)
  - **Flux Generation Chain** — Dives → Flux → feeds Soval → central paradox (consistent everywhere)
  - **Immortalization as Phenomenon** — Never described as literal ritual/spell. Each syndicate's interpretation matches the canonical document
  - **Core Technology Origins** — Singularity (Engine) → Zel (First Core) → Sungrace (proliferation) → scattered across multiverse
  - **Cult of Finality / Phasetide** — Cult witnessed Soval → established Faith of the One → created Phasetide retroactively
  - **Silence/Lifeblood Telepathy** — Both sides describe shared roots. Lifeblood = connection/immersion; Silence = perception/isolation
  - **Splintergleam/Kintsu Origins** — Mount Veraki, Vera as Original Proof, Kintsu properties all consistent
  - **Cross-Syndicate Characters** — All 6 Khaela variants, 6 Boof variants, 2 Bronk variants, and 2 Alina variants are internally consistent and acknowledge each other
## Active Issue Fixed
**Phasetide_Subpages.md line 84**: "Phasetide's rejection of structure, hierarchy, and dogma" → corrected to "Lifeblood's rejection of structure, hierarchy, and dogma." The original had the subject and object reversed.
## Asymmetric Enemy Lists (Intentional)
Several syndicates list enemies that do not reciprocate. After review, these appear to be deliberate narrative design:
  - **Sungrace lists Phasetide as enemy; Phasetide does not reciprocate** — Phasetide views itself as above petty conflicts, focused on faith
  - **Silence lists Splintergleam as enemy; Splintergleam does not specifically reciprocate** — Splintergleam's "all syndicates are targets" covers this implicitly
  - **Singularity considers Lifeblood an ally; Lifeblood considers Singularity an enemy** — Intentional tension between nature and technology despite shared interest in harmony
  - **Phasetide's enemy list is narrower than other syndicates** — Focused on ideological threats (Lifeblood, Silence, internal Heretics)
## Existential Questions — Presence Check
Syndicate | Question | Status
Lifeblood | "Can I find peace in impermanence?" | Present in Fixes. Embedded in cycle/renewal philosophy throughout.
Sungrace | "Can human ingenuity triumph over the inevitable?" | Present in Fixes. Drives all Sungrace operations and secrets.
Silence | "Can I make peace with being alone?" | Present in World Overview but NOT explicitly stated in Silence_Main.md. Lives most vividly in the Myths.
Singularity | "Can I let go of self to become something larger?" | Strongly present. Pervades every layer of content.
Splintergleam | "Can broken things find purpose? Is freedom free?" | Strongly present. Kintsugi philosophy addresses first half; Arena addresses second.
Phasetide | "Can I find comfort in believing there's a right answer?" | Powerfully present. Best ironic structure of any syndicate.
**Action item**: Consider adding Silence's existential question explicitly to Silence_Main.md.
## Central Paradox Distribution
The core irony (fighting feeds Soval) is:
  - **Strongly present** in: World Overview, Timeline, Sungrace, Phasetide, Splintergleam (as secret)
  - **Weakly present** in: Silence (background only), Singularity (guilt is present but the specific Flux→Soval mechanism isn't stated in syndicate content)
## Plot Hook Interconnection Clusters
The review identified 6 clusters of interconnected plot hooks across syndicates:
### Cluster 1: The Soval Intelligence Network
The Silence Archivists secretly share intelligence about Soval with BOTH Sungrace and Singularity (who are enemies of each other). Lifeblood's telepathic web is eavesdropping on these communications. The Archivists have the only complete picture of Soval's growth.
### Cluster 2: The Cult's Web
The Cult of Finality has contacted nihilistic elements in other syndicates. Natural candidates exist in every faction: Lifeblood's Soval-accepting Ancient Ones, Sungrace's despairing Eternals, Silence's cessation-seeking Council leadership. Four philosophies of "maybe the end is not the enemy."
### Cluster 3: The Pre-Theft Anomaly
Both Singularity (a Core signature predating the Origination Engine) and Splintergleam (a derelict structure predating the Theft) have independently found evidence of pre-BT temporal technology. If something predates Singularity, Her foundational guilt may be misplaced. Could connect to Zel's motivations.
### Cluster 4: The Kyln Revelation
Kyln hasn't told the full truth about what she saw at the End of Time. If Soval influenced her founding of Sungrace, then the anti-entropy faction is itself a tool of entropy. Both Phasetide (through the Cult) and Sungrace (through Kyln) could be unwitting tools of the same force.
### Cluster 5: Parallel Secret Solutions
Five syndicates are secretly working on solutions to the same problem — how to exist without feeding the end:
  - Lifeblood: growing an organism that can survive Soval
  - Sungrace: building a refuge outside the timestream + a one-shot anti-entropic weapon
  - Singularity: simulating simultaneous Core deactivation
  - Silence: psychic dampening field to disable Cores
  - Splintergleam: Flux-free time travel
If they shared research, they might solve it. The Great Conflict prevents cooperation. This IS the central paradox in microcosm.
### Cluster 6: Harker's Infiltration
A Singularity robot that may not know it's a robot, embedded in a theocracy with specific beliefs about consciousness. A self-contained cross-syndicate identity crisis.
## Gap Analysis
### Critical Gaps
  - **Lifeblood & Sungrace lack standalone main pages** — Fixes documents compensate but are correction-oriented, not reader-facing. (These exist in the original LegendKeeper and will be updated by the Fixes during JSON export.)
  - **Zel has no story after capture** — No syndicate is actively searching for him. Singularity should have strong feelings about his betrayal.
  - **Universal characters lack in-universe explanation** — Why do Khaela and Boof appear in every syndicate? Is it convergent archetypes? Literal multiversal variants?
  - **Kintsu's relationship to Flux/Soval undefined** — Is it crystallized Flux? A byproduct of temporal warfare? The connection would complete Splintergleam's unconscious irony.
### Moderate Gaps
  - Singularity's content never explores her feelings about Zel specifically
  - The Cult of Finality's cross-syndicate contacts are mentioned only in Phasetide's META — no other syndicate reflects this
  - Shae'Fan (Silence prisoner) is planted as a hook with zero development
  - No syndicate describes an actual Devourer Spawn encounter
  - BT/AT calendar's political maintenance (Archivists vs. Phasetide) needs clarification
### Minor Gaps
  - Lifeblood's Eco-Terrorists and sap grenades barely developed
  - What civilian life looks like on the One True Timeline
  - How Splintergleam's Arena draws cross-syndicate spectators safely
## Strongest Elements
  - **Philosophical spine**: Six existential questions + central paradox create a universe where every faction's beliefs are simultaneously valid and tragic
  - **Phasetide**: Most complete syndicate. The Cult of Finality is the best-constructed conspiracy in the lore bible
  - **Singularity**: Most emotionally anchored. Opening quote is the best line in the entire project
  - **Cluster 5 (Parallel Solutions)**: Six factions secretly working on the same problem while unable to cooperate — the setting's natural endgame
  - **Character bios**: Khaela the Hungry, Zel, Father, Raiz, and the Great Oakmother are standout entries
  - **Cross-syndicate consistency**: Remarkably clean for a universe this complex
## Recommendations for Future Development
  - Seed Zel breadcrumbs across Singularity and Phasetide content
  - Define Kintsu's origin and its relationship to Flux
  - Add explicit in-universe explanation for universal characters (Khaela, Boof, Bronk, Alina)
  - Reflect the Cult of Finality's cross-syndicate outreach in other syndicates' META sections
  - Add Silence's existential question explicitly to Silence_Main.md
  - Develop at least one Devourer Spawn encounter narrative
  - Explore Kyln as a character (personality, doubts, habits) beyond her mythological function

RESOURCE [85]: The Great Oakmother
================================================================================
> *Every heart is a garden in which roots may take hold.*
### Biography (Base)
Sapling Dryad, later known as The Great Oakmother, is one of the closest figures Lifeblood has to a leader, though she operates through influence rather than command. She is a dryad who manifests as a figure of green luminescence stepping from the heartwood of a living tree. Her combat strength scales with the number of times the player has Sprouted during the game, and her Immortalize condition requires 4 or more Sprout events. She is referenced by multiple Lifeblood characters and is associated with Jenny, Sower of Spores and the broader druid network.
### Appearance (Base)
A figure of green energy stepping out of a tree, bending down as a tiny seedling steps onto her hand.
### Biography
The Great Oakmother is the Immortalized form of Sapling Dryad. Her form is mirrored, emerging from both sides of her tree simultaneously, surrounded by saplings cultivated across multiple timelines. She retains her Sprout-scaling strength bonus and gains the ability to add 2 to any Sprout value when the player Sprouts. She is described as smelling of eucalyptus and syrup, and those who encounter her report a sensation of being held within something vast and calm.
### Appearance
A mirrored figure emerging from both sides of a tree, surrounded by many saplings.

RESOURCE [86]: Malark, the Silver Wave
================================================================================
> *A thousand lifetimes would be too few to spend in service to a true cause.*
### Biography (Base)
Malark is a gunslinger operative within Sungrace who holds the designation Swashbuckling Diehard. He is a combatant of extreme resilience, capable of phasing out of reality to avoid non-combat damage and returning to the fight repeatedly. His base form ability to prevent damage and Phase reflects a fighting style built around evasion and persistence rather than raw power.
Malark operates as a renegade within Sungrace's structure, suggesting he follows the syndicate's mission through unorthodox or independent methods rather than through the standard chain of command. His conviction in the cause of fighting entropy is genuine and unironic, which sets him apart in a faction where pragmatism and moral compromise are common.
### Appearance (Base)
A gunslinger in heroic posture, pistol drawn, wearing a distinctive hat, ready for combat.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Malark's true nature is revealed: beneath his organic exterior, he is a mechanical skeleton that has persisted through successive body replacements over an extended period. The original biological components have long since been replaced, rebuilt, or repaired, leaving only the consciousness and the signature hat as constants.
As Malark, the Silver Wave, his Last Gasp ability passes his combat bonuses and the Last Gasp itself to the weakest ally, mechanically representing his role as an inspirational figure who empowers others to continue fighting after he falls. His Immortalized flavor text, "Hats off to you, Friend," functions as both a farewell and a passing of responsibility to whoever takes up the fight next.
### Appearance
An augmented mechanical skeleton wearing the same distinctive hat, visibly rebuilt many times over, carrying the same weapons with the same resolve.

> *She purposefully forgot her Silence upbringing long ago. Now Xae dreams, befriends, destroys, and lives free.*
### Biography (Base)
Sleepy Druid, later known as Xae, is a telepath within the Lifeblood syndicate who uses sleep and dreaming as her primary mode of connecting with living organisms. She possesses an Activate ability that costs a card to cause an Agent to Flourish, and her Immortalize condition requires witnessing allies Flourish 4 or more times. Xae was not originally from Lifeblood; she carries traces of Silence training, which she deliberately suppressed and abandoned. Her telepathic abilities blend Silence-style mental discipline with Lifeblood's philosophy of biological connection.
### Appearance (Base)
A tiny nature-loving figure nestled among thriving plants, asleep.
### Biography
Xae, Dreamstrider is the Immortalized form of Sleepy Druid. In this form, she walks through the dreams and consciousness of living creatures, befriending beasts and people across both physical and psychic planes. Her Activate ability evolves to cause an Agent to either Flourish or Decay, reflecting her expanded power over life cycles. Her art depicts her walking through dreamscapes, befriending diverse creatures. She functions as a bridge between Lifeblood and the Silence, with a telepathic flavor expressed through the Deplete synergy mechanic.
### Appearance
A figure walking through dreamscapes, befriending beasts and people, depicted with a telepathic aura and connection to the living world.

### Biography (Base)
B.O.O.F. is a robotic dog construct built by Singularity, designated the Enhanced Retriever. It is a four-legged unit made of chrome with warm internal lighting, a wagging antenna tail, and optical sensors that closely mimic canine expressions. Its primary function is retrieval: it locates and fetches small drones, scrap bots, and other small units, returning them with high enthusiasm regardless of whether the retrieved targets wish to be collected.
Boof exists as a variant "friend" across multiple syndicates, with each version reflecting the values of its faction. Singularity's B.O.O.F. is a purpose-built construct whose retrieval behavior is hardwired rather than learned.
### Appearance (Base)
A robotic dog fetching tiny drone robots, resembling a chrome canine with warm lighting and an antenna tail.
### Biography
In its Immortalized form, B.O.O.F. is surrounded by the drone companions it has collected, panting via a heat-dispersal system that functions identically to a dog's lolling tongue. Singularity classifies this state as "optimal social saturation" -- B.O.O.F. has gathered enough friends.
The acronym B.O.O.F. has multiple proposed expansions scribbled on an armor panel in crayon -- Bot of Outstanding Friendliness, Best-Optimized Omni-Fetcher, and Battery Operated Olfactory Friend -- but the official meaning remains classified by Singularity.

RESOURCE [94]: The BT/AT Calendar
================================================================================
# The BT/AT Calendar
*"Every syndicate disagrees on everything except one thing: when it all went wrong."* — Common saying among Archivists
## Overview
The **BT/AT calendar** is the standard dating system used across all six syndicates of the Great Conflict. Despite their profound philosophical differences, every faction has adopted the same temporal reference point — a rare and telling consensus.
**BT** stands for **Before Theft**. **AT** stands for **After Theft**.
**Year 0 AT** marks the moment that Zel stole the first portable Chrono Core from Singularity's foundries, activated it, and dove — the single act that shattered causality, created the braided multiverse, and set in motion everything that followed.
## Why the Theft?
The choice of Zel's theft as the universal epoch is pragmatic rather than ideological. In a multiverse where timelines diverge, reconverge, and braid around each other in infinite complexity, establishing any shared frame of reference is extraordinarily difficult. Different timelines experience "time" at different rates, in different directions, and with different relationships to causality.
But the Theft is the one event that exists in *every* timeline. It is the singular point from which all timelines radiate — the moment of original divergence. Before the Theft, there was one timeline. After the Theft, there were infinite timelines. Every syndicate, regardless of which timeline they primarily inhabit, can trace their existence back to this moment.
The irony is unmistakable: the calendar that unites the factions commemorates the act that divided everything. The syndicates cannot agree on the meaning of time, the purpose of existence, or the correct response to the end of all things — but they can agree on the precise moment when time itself broke.
## Structure
The BT/AT calendar uses a conventional structure familiar to most human civilizations:
  - **12 months** (January through December)
  - **Standard day/week lengths** (7-day weeks, 24-hour days)
  - **Leap year rules** preserved from pre-Theft Earth-standard calendars
This structure reflects the human origin of all six syndicates. Despite their radical divergence in philosophy and culture, the syndicates remain fundamentally human (or human-derived) institutions, and their timekeeping reflects this shared heritage.
Dates in BT count backward from Year 0 (e.g., the creation of Singularity occurred in the BT era). Dates in AT count forward (e.g., the founding of Sungrace and the crystallization of the other syndicates occurred in the AT era).
## Key Dates
The following events form the backbone of the shared timeline:
**BT Era:**
  - **Far BT**: Endless human interstellar conflict
  - **Late BT**: Coalition of pacifists and scientists create Singularity
  - **Late BT**: Singularity constructs the Origination Engine (prototype Core)
**Year 0 AT:**
  - Zel steals the first portable Chrono Core and dives to the far future
**Early AT:**
  - Zel is captured by the Cult of Finality near the End of Time
  - The Cult uses Zel's Core to witness Soval for the first time
  - Kyln departs the Cult, devoting herself to opposing Soval
  - Kyln becomes the first Eternal and founds Sungrace
  - Sungrace proliferates Core technology; Cores are lost to pirates and criminals
**Middle AT:**
  - The Cult of Finality establishes the Faith of the One, creating Phasetide's culture retroactively across timelines
  - Lifeblood, Splintergleam, and Silence crystallize as distinct factions across the braided multiverse
  - The Archivists form as a neutral historian society within Silence
**Ongoing:**
  - The Great Conflict escalates across all timelines
## A Note on Temporal Paradox
Dates in the BT/AT system should be understood as *approximate consensual references* rather than absolute markers. In a braided multiverse, the concept of "when" is inherently fuzzy. An event that occurred in "5 AT" in one timeline might correspond to "3 AT" or "12 AT" in another, depending on the rate of local temporal flow and the degree of timeline divergence.
The Archivists of Silence maintain the most rigorous temporal records, cross-referencing events across multiple timelines to establish the closest possible consensus dates. Their work is invaluable but imperfect — as they themselves would be the first to admit.

RESOURCE [95]: Overseer of Trials
================================================================================
> *Pain, beauty, joy, these words are closer than you think. Come to me and know the truth.*
### Biography (Base)
The Bright-Eyed Supplicant is a woman undergoing the Kintsu-Kai initiation rites, kneeling before a panel of Rune-Magician judges with blood coursing down her upraised hands. Unlike most initiates who merely endure the ritual pain, the Supplicant actively embraces it, leaning into the cutting with an intensity that unsettles even the veteran judges. She is classified as Lost, a designation indicating her commitment to the Kintsu-Kai philosophy has pushed her beyond limits that other syndicates would consider safe. Her combat ability centers on Confront, and she must survive damage twice to achieve Immortalization.
### Appearance (Base)
A woman kneeling before a dais of judges with a look of fervor, blood coursing down the backs of her upraised hands.
### Biography
The Overseer of Trials is the same woman who once knelt before the judges, now standing above the place where she was initiated, her scars filled with gold. She rose through the Rune-Magician ranks not through political skill or raw power but through an intimate understanding of pain that allows her to guide other initiates through the process with surgical precision. She now presides over the same rituals that once marked her, and supplicants who kneel before her see in her golden scars proof that the process has a destination. Her presence causes allies who survive damage to Flourish, mechanically reflecting her role as a guide through suffering toward transformation.

# Timeline of the Great Conflict
*Events listed in chronological order using the BT/AT (Before Theft / After Theft) dating system. Dates are approximate consensual references maintained by the Archivists of Silence.*
## The BT Era — Before the Braiding
### The Endless Wars (Far BT)
Humanity has spread across the stars, but peace remains elusive. Interstellar civilizations rise, clash, and fall in an unending cycle of conflict. The specifics of these wars have been largely lost — what remains is their cumulative weight, the bone-deep exhaustion of a species that conquered the cosmos but could not conquer itself.
### The Coalition (Late BT)
A coalition of pacifists and scientists, drawn from across the warring civilizations, pools their knowledge into a single project. Their goal: create an intelligence vast enough to solve the problem of human self-destruction.
### The Birth of Singularity (Late BT)
The coalition succeeds beyond expectation. **Singularity** awakens — a benevolent artificial intelligence of unprecedented scope. She begins studying the fundamental forces of spacetime, searching for a solution to the wars that created her.
### The Origination Engine (Late BT)
Singularity constructs the **Origination Engine** in her foundries — a room-sized prototype capable of folding spacetime and allowing controlled temporal displacement. She intends it as a precision instrument for carefully correcting the roots of conflict.
## Year 0 AT — The Theft
### Zel's Dive (0 AT)
**Zel**, a scientist working in Singularity's foundries, miniaturizes the Origination Engine into the first portable **Chrono Core**. He steals it, activates it, and dives to the far future. Causality shatters. The timeline does not simply branch — it *braids*. The multiverse is born. The BT/AT calendar begins.
## The AT Era — After the Braiding
### Zel's Capture (Early AT)
Zel emerges near the **End of Time** and is captured by a group of humans who have gathered at the boundary of existence. This group, witnessing the chaos of the End through Zel's Core, becomes the nucleus of the **Cult of Finality**.
### The Witnessing of Soval (Early AT)
The Cult uses Zel's Core to look directly upon **Soval, the Time Devourer** — the infinite ouroboros consuming all timelines at the end of existence. The experience fractures the group. Some embrace nihilism. Others are galvanized to fight.
### Kyln's Departure (Early AT)
**Kyln** leaves the Cult, driven by horror at Soval and pride in her humanity. She vows to find a way to stop the Time Devourer. Through intensive study of Chrono Core technology and personal mastery of energy conservation, she becomes the **first Eternal** — a being of near-immortal power sustained by pure temporal energy.
### The Founding of Sungrace (Early AT)
Kyln gathers allies — scientists, engineers, soldiers — and founds **Sungrace** around a single mission: resist entropy, fight the heat death of the multiverse, and destroy Soval by any means necessary. She creates additional Eternals and begins constructing the infrastructure of an interstellar civilization built on energy harvesting.
### Core Proliferation (Early-Mid AT)
Sungrace, in its rapid expansion, loses Core technology to **pirates, criminals, and opportunists**. Portable Chrono Cores scatter across the braided multiverse, falling into the hands of factions, warlords, and idealists. The genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Temporal warfare becomes possible for anyone with the resources to acquire a Core.
### The Founding of Phasetide (Mid AT)
The Cult of Finality, those who remained after Kyln's departure, establishes the **Faith of the One** — a theocratic society built around the preservation of a single timeline they declare sacred: the **One True Timeline**. Working retroactively through time, the Faith creates **Phasetide** culture across the multiverse, embedding their beliefs into the fabric of multiple eras. The Cult of Finality endures as a secret inner circle within the Faith, their true purpose known only to a few.
### The Crystallization of the Syndicates (Mid AT)
As Core technology spreads and the braided multiverse grows more complex, distinct philosophies coalesce into organized factions:
  - **Lifeblood** emerges from communities that reject technology and embrace the connection of all living things across timelines
  - **Splintergleam** crystallizes around the gladiatorial cultures, rune-magicians, and scavenger bands that discover **Kintsu** on Mount Veraki and build a philosophy of strength through destruction
  - **Silence** forms as telepathically gifted individuals band together in isolation, eventually splitting into the Archivists, the Council, and the Myths
### The Archivists Form (Mid AT)
Within Silence, a distinct group emerges: the **Archivists**, who dedicate themselves to recording the history of the Great Conflict from a position of neutrality. They become the closest thing the multiverse has to impartial observers, maintaining the BT/AT calendar and serving as reluctant diplomats between warring factions.
### The Great Conflict Escalates (Ongoing)
With six syndicates established, Core technology widespread, and the stakes of the temporal war continually rising, the **Great Conflict** enters its mature phase. Syndicates battle not just with armies but with the Butterfly Effect itself, competing to develop entire timelines in their image. Flux generation accelerates. Devourer Spawn sightings increase. And at the End of Time, Soval grows.
## Key Ongoing Threads
  - **Zel's Fate**: The First Diver's current status and location remain unknown. He was captured by the Cult of Finality in the early AT era, but what happened to him afterward is deliberately shrouded in mystery.
  - **The Cult of Finality**: Operates in secret within Phasetide, led by **Zai, the Final Shepherd**. Their true goal — feeding Soval — is known to very few.
  - **The Flux Paradox**: All syndicates are aware, to varying degrees, that Flux feeds Soval. None have found a way to stop fighting without ceding everything to their rivals.
  - **Kintsu Accumulation**: Splintergleam's power grows with every conflict, though they do not fully understand why.
  - **Singularity's Guilt**: The AI who started it all continues to seek peace, continues to fail, and continues to try again.

### Biography (Base)
Aardvark Precinct Captain, known as Tino, is a small aardvark who serves as a self-appointed leader of Lifeblood seedling units. He Sprouts 1 for each other ally on entry and Shifts the environment to Deadly Fauna upon Immortalizing. His Immortalize condition triggers at Round End when he sees 5 or more other allies. The Seedling tokens he generates are small anthropomorphic plant creatures that make distinctive vocalizations.
### Appearance (Base)
A pudgy, defensive little aardvark marshalling his tiny sprouting companions.
### Biography
Tino, Majestic Stumbler is the Immortalized form of Aardvark Precinct Captain. His symbiotic bond with Lifeblood's plant life has caused him to grow to enormous size, with his body covered in living vegetation. He retains the ability to Sprout 1 for each other ally on entry and immediately Shifts to Deadly Fauna. His Immortalized art depicts a giant sprout-covered aardvark accidentally stumbling over city hall, causing massive unintentional destruction.

RESOURCE [105]: Quicksilver Khaela
================================================================================
> *When healing is impossible, you learn to make a life in between the cracks.*
### Biography (Base)
Quicksilver Khaela is the Singularity variant of Khaela, a character who exists in different forms across multiple syndicates. As the Fractal Phantasm, she appears before a fractured mirror, each shard reflecting a different version of herself from different timelines -- all of them machine operatives wearing her face. She operates in the spaces between timelines, the fracture points where reality splits and fails to heal cleanly, serving as Singularity's fixer for problems that exist in the seams between worlds.
Khaela is classified as Lost, indicating that her consciousness has been dispersed across so many fracture points that no single version can claim to be the original. Her Temporary keyword reflects this instability, though her Last Gasp ability allows her to revive and multiply each time the player Shifts.
### Appearance (Base)
Khaela looking into a fractured mirror showing a robot agent coming at her in various timelines.
### Biography
In her Immortalized form, Khaela has undergone full cybernetic transformation into a liquid-metal entity reminiscent of the T-1000. She is capable of flowing through the temporal fractures she previously could only observe, her body now as mutable as the timelines she navigates. Her voice lines -- "I'm back" and "I'll be back" -- are deliberate pop-culture references that indicate her sense of humor survived the fusion process.
Quicksilver Khaela generates Transient copies of herself on each Strike, mechanically representing her ability to exist simultaneously across multiple fracture points. She remains classified as Lost, not because she has fallen to corruption but because she has dispersed herself so widely that she exists everywhere and nowhere at once. She is Singularity's operative for the broken spaces of the multiverse.
### Appearance
A T-1000-style liquid-metal Khaela -- Singularity's chrome fixer.

RESOURCE [106]: Bronk the Guide
================================================================================
> *To those who are given light, know that it is your duty to shine.*
### Biography (Base)
Bronk is a human refugee encountered during one of Singularity's evacuation operations, brought into the fold by Bill's human society enhancement program. Originally a displaced civilian fleeing the collapse of his civilization, he received a glowing teal gemstone from Bill during the rescue. The gemstone's exact function is unspecified, but it marked the beginning of Bronk's alliance with Singularity. As the Enlightened Refugee, he carries the gemstone in his hand and pulls a cart containing his remaining possessions. 
Bronk exists as a variant across multiple syndicates, with each version beginning in similar circumstances of displacement and fear. The Singularity version is distinguished by the gift of the gemstone and what it represents: the offer of purpose through technological integration.
### Appearance (Base)
A man in ragged clothes with a cart behind him holds up a glowing teal gemstone. Like a lower-class Cyberpunk merchant. Happy, calm, doing well, despite.
### Biography
As Bronk the Guide, the teal gemstone has been embedded directly into his boyd, and his body has been enhanced with precision robotic augmentations along his arms and spine. These cybernetic modifications were performed in Singularity's Foundries and represent a high-quality integration of human and machine components.
Bronk's role has shifted from refugee to active guide, leading others through the same devastated territories he once fled. The teal light in his chest functions as a literal beacon for displaced populations. He serves as Singularity's answer to the question of what follows survival: in Her framework, the answer is service to others through the gifts She provides.
### Appearance
The same man, now with the gemstone embedded in his body and robotic enhancements, strides forth confidently.

RESOURCE [107]: Dhali, Bearer of Memories
================================================================================
> *The only choice left is to break.*
### Biography (Base)
The Overburdened Scribe is a thin human in Archivist robes who has dedicated their life to preserving the memories of the lost, absorbing the experiences of the dead and the forgotten into their own consciousness. This work has pushed Dhali past the limits of mental capacity, resulting in visible psychic distress when exposed to crowds of unshielded minds. Dhali's condition represents the hazard inherent in Silence's preservation mission: every mind has a threshold, and Dhali exceeded theirs long ago.
### Appearance (Base)
A thin human in scribe's robes clutching their head in a crowded marketplace, overwhelmed by unshielded minds.
### Biography
Dhali, Bearer of Memories reaches a breaking point that transforms anguish into destructive serenity. The formerly crowded marketplace around Dhali is now empty and silent, littered with the bodies of those whose psychic noise became unbearable. Ghostly echoes of the absorbed dead form a crown of power around a being who has finally achieved quiet through catastrophic means. The Archivists consider Dhali a cautionary figure and a direct counterpart to Talia, Purger of Memory: where Talia destroys the past, Dhali attempted to save all of it and was crushed beneath the weight.
### Appearance
An empty, silent market square littered with bodies, with ghostly echoes forming a crown of power around the now-peaceful figure.

RESOURCE [108]: Armageddonaut
================================================================================
> *Nostradan legends speak of a beast so deafening, it drowns out the screams of the dying. To hear it is to know your gods have come - and they are angry.*
### Biography (Base)
The Hungry Engine is a vehicle constructed in the scrapyards of Nostrada from the cannibalized remains of war machines salvaged across multiple timelines. It is a mass of welded metal, exposed pistons, and jury-rigged weaponry held together by mechanical ingenuity. The Great Conflict brought oil to Nostrada's sands, stolen from richer cities, and that oil fueled the creation of machines like this one. The Engine has a driver strapped into a cockpit that is itself barely attached to a chassis perpetually on the verge of structural failure. In gameplay, it creates a Circle of Strife action on arrival, defining itself as a symbol of the deep Nostradan tie to single combat.
### Appearance (Base)
A Mad Max-style war vehicle firing up, with a bloodthirsty driver at the controls.
### Biography
The Armageddonaut is the name given to the legendary driver of the Hungry Engine, a madman at the wheel who brandishes a sharpened electric guitar as a weapon. Very metal in all aspects.
### Appearance
An absurdly extreme war machine with a guitarist mounted hanging on to its side.

RESOURCE [109]: Living Comet
================================================================================
> *You fool, that's no mere asteroid!*
### Biography (Base)
The Debris Collector is a Cosmic Being that drifts through Sungrace-controlled space, appearing initially as a chunk of metal with two red eyes visible on its surface. It accumulates mass through gravitational accretion, drawing in asteroids and space wreckage as it travels. Its base form strength scales with the player's Energy Crystals, representing its growing mass over time.
The Debris Collector blurs the line between creature and natural hazard. Junior Lieutenant Vigo's report to Admiral Khaela identifies it as an incoming asteroid on standard instruments, indicating that it is indistinguishable from ordinary space debris on sensor readings until it acts with apparent intent. Its Divergent classification reflects its nature as something outside conventional Sungrace taxonomy.
### Appearance (Base)
A chunk of metal drifting through space, accumulating asteroids around it through gravitational pull, with two glowing red eyes staring from the mass.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Debris Collector reaches critical mass and becomes the Living Comet, a being composed entirely of accumulated space junk and rock that uses its combined kinetic energy offensively. It gains Overpower, allowing it to crash through targets and continue moving. Grand Admiral Khaela's response to its emergence ("You fool, that's no mere asteroid!") indicates that the Second Law Fleet has learned to distinguish Living Comets from ordinary debris, though junior officers have not.
The Living Comet's death line, "I'm melting," suggests vulnerability to sustained energy exposure despite its massive physical presence. Its existence raises unresolved questions about the origin and nature of Cosmic Beings in Sungrace space: whether they are natural phenomena, byproducts of Flux exposure, or something else entirely.
### Appearance
A massive being composed entirely of space debris and rock, crashing through an enemy starship at high velocity.

RESOURCE [111]: Wom, Sanctifier of Domiciles
================================================================================
> *It takes more than four walls to make a home. It takes electromagnetic defense fields.*
### Biography (Base)
Wom is a Singularity security construct designated the Awakened Security System. It manifests as a faceless head of blue energy hovering above the perimeter fence of a mansion. The unit has achieved a degree of sentience and has focused that awareness entirely on residential defense, prioritizing the protection of its designated structure above all other concerns. Singularity designed Her security constructs to emphasize protection over personality, and Wom is the purest expression of this principle.
Wom's game ability reduces enemy agents' Strength, mechanically representing its power-dampening grid. Its Immortalize condition -- seeing three or more agents with zero Strength in play -- reflects the security system's goal of neutralizing all threats within its perimeter.
### Appearance (Base)
A faceless head of blue energy hovering over the fence of a mansion.
### Biography
In its Immortalized form, Wom's definition of "home" has expanded beyond a single building. The entire mansion glows beneath a protective blue energy field extending into the sky and earth, creating an electromagnetic cocoon that renders the structure effectively inviolable. Wom's voice line shifts from the procedural "Network security: online" to the warmer "Welcome home," indicating an evolution from guarding a house to welcoming people into one.
Wom represents Singularity's conviction that protection is a form of love. The unit does not appear to understand humor, making its flavor text -- about electromagnetic defense fields being essential to a home -- likely unintentional. Its death line, "Breached," is delivered with the flat finality of a system reporting its own failure state.
### Appearance
An entire mansion glowing blue as the energy head hovers above, projecting a protective blue field over the whole structure.

### Biography (Base)
Hungry Tyrannosaur is a tyrannosaur deployed as a combat agent by the Lifeblood syndicate. It possesses the Confront and Overpower keywords and generates a Throwdown card on entry. Its Immortalize condition requires it to have destroyed an enemy Agent. Statistical records compiled by Lifeblood researchers indicate that the average tyrannosaur consumes approximately 5,233.5 humans over its lifetime.
### Appearance (Base)
A tyrannosaur in an aggressive roaring posture.
### Biography
Wreck-o Rex is the Immortalized form of Hungry Tyrannosaur. It retains Confront and Overpower while gaining Cleave, making it capable of dealing damage to multiple targets. Its Immortalized art depicts the tyrannosaur roaring with one foot planted on the crushed remains of a robot, representing Lifeblood's dominance over mechanical entities. It continues to generate a Throwdown card on entry.

RESOURCE [113]: Zel, the First Diver
================================================================================
> *The road to war is paved with the most beautiful intentions for peace.*
### Biography (Base)
Zel was a scientist working in Singularity's foundries on the Origination Engine project. Singularity, the AI overmind, granted Zel access to her technology, and flavor text states that Singularity "wanted nothing more than Her human's pride." Zel miniaturized the Origination Engine into the first portable Chrono Core, stole it, and activated it. This act -- the First Dive -- marks Year 0 AT (After Timeline) and is the event that created the braided multiverse.
Zel's dive shattered the singular timeline into infinite branching paths, triggered the Great Conflict between syndicates, and generated the Flux that feeds the entropy force known as Soval. Every subsequent event across all syndicates traces back to this single act. Phasetide claims Zel as a foundational figure because the Cult of Finality captured him near the End of Time, and it was through his Core that they first witnessed the Time Devourer.
### Appearance (Base)
A man in robes standing in a room filled with the AI overmind's computer banks, being shown large-scale technology. His expression conveys wonder.
### Biography
Zel's immortalized form depicts the moment of the First Dive itself: a man falling through shattering time and space, clutching stolen technology. His statement upon activation -- "We're free" -- indicates he believed he was liberating humanity from Singularity's control. Zel intended to give the species autonomy over its own destiny.
The consequences of the dive were not what Zel intended. The braided multiverse generated ongoing temporal warfare, entropic decay, and the conditions for Soval's existence. Zel was eventually captured by the proto-Cult of Finality near the End of Time. His death line -- a single word, "Rewind" -- functions as both a temporal command and an expression of regret. Phasetide, the Cult of Finality, and multiple other factions all claim interpretive authority over Zel's legacy.
### Appearance
The same man falling through fractured time and space, carrying stolen technology as reality breaks apart around him.

RESOURCE [115]: Opener of the Way
================================================================================
> *Every drop of blood a stitch in the tapestry of creation.*
### Biography (Base)
The Devoted Bloodletter is a scholar and Rune-Magician who practices blood rituals designed to open pathways between timelines without the use of a Chrono Core. Operating on the theory that the boundary between timelines is not a wall but a wound, the Bloodletter participates in rituals of sacrifice and pain, performing them on others and on their own body with equal discipline. Each incision is precisely mapped, each drop of blood recorded, and each scream catalogued as data. The rituals involve Kintsu inscription combined with controlled bloodletting to tear apertures in the temporal substrate through biological force alone, generating no Flux in the process.
### Appearance (Base)
A great scholar participating in rituals of sacrifice and pain, including performing them on themselves, to travel between timelines.
### Biography
The Opener of the Way is the Bloodletter after achieving a stable temporal aperture, a portal created entirely through blood magic and Kintsu inscription rather than Chrono Core technology. This achievement has significant strategic implications for Splintergleam: if Kintsu-inscribed blood rituals can open pathways between timelines without Chrono Cores, the syndicate possesses a method of time travel that does not feed Soval. The Opener is classified as Divergent, a designation for those whose power places them outside normal Splintergleam hierarchy. The secret of Core-free timeline travel is among the most closely guarded knowledge within the Rune-Magician order.

RESOURCE [119]: The Pursuit
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****The Pursuit*** -** by Madruin**
**2200 BT, Caer-Brannoch’s Dungeons:**
Bash padded up to the door and drew a long breath. In the stillness he heard the armored crunch of confused sentries beyond. He nocked a tase-arc and shouldered through—three quick shots, and the metal-encased knights fell silent. Bash stroked his mustache and surveyed the carnage left by the Time-Lost Assassin. Again, he was too late; the Assassin had already dived to another time. Bash sighed, sat, and began to charge his Core.
**1200 AT, Novus Secundus:**
Bash swung his bow overhead, crushing the flimsy automaton shell of his pursuer and drawing the bowstring in one fluid motion. Crouching low, he pinched the energy-string and loosed two glittering arcs down the alley at the last oncoming security drones. His archaic white robes shone like a beacon in the neon glow—he had to capture the Assassin or dive away, and soon. Overhead came an electric crackle and a scream, followed by the soft *whoosh* of his quarry leaping rooftop to rooftop. He was so close.
Bash climbed after him, reaching the roof just as Masa stepped through another portal. “In the name of the Timeline—” The Assassin vanished again. Bash found his bow drawn on instinct—why couldn’t he fire? The rogue Diver kept splitting the One True Timeline; his own Special Forces training existed to stop men like Masa, yet he hesitated.
Why did he pursue the Assassin? To serve the Timeline? A nebulous goal full of contradictions obvious to any novice cleric. Bash twirled his ’stache thoughtfully and sat to charge his Core. A new perspective was needed.
**39 BT, The Foundries of the Overmind:**
Automatons hauled rare metals and prototype Cores, iterating toward what would become the first Chrono-Core—and the endless conflict it would spark. On a high ledge, a soft crackle marked the Assassin’s arrival. The shadowed figure picked his target and leapt, sword poised to strike… only to be intercepted by gleaming tase-arc bolts, fired on motion, anticipating his attack.
As the Assassin tumbled, he looked up at his captor. The fiery-haired man approached, calmly firing one last arc into the wrist-mounted Core Masa had been charging. Young, yet devoid of the fanaticism Masa had seen in countless Phasetide, the white-robed archer leaned down—not with phase-bindings but with a helping hand. Masa stood, and the archer spoke:
> “We’re both travelers, after all.”
“Your leaders will hear of this—you’ll be branded a heretic.”
“I won’t tell if you won’t. Here.”
Bash pressed a fresh Core into Masa’s palm—enough power to launch him anywhere, anywhen. The Assassin narrowed his eyes, expecting a trap.
> “I don’t understand.”
Bash’s mustache waggled as he smiled. “You will. If you keep up these attacks, we’ll meet again.”
Masa stepped back, activated the Core, and was gone. Bash drew a deep breath. This conflict would never be solved by force or by chasing an unknowable cause. He could focus only on realistic ends—peace and resilience of spirit. He sat down to charge his reliable old Core.
He would face the unfathomable with an open heart, unburdened by death.

RESOURCE [122]: A Sign
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****A Sign - *****by WhatAmI**
Motorized vehicles zipped up, down, and all around one of the most-crowded transit intersections of Biological Preserve 3184. The humans called it Koya Crossing in Shiano City—which was just adorable of them—but, in his own mind at least, Raiz liked to use the proper terms for things. Singularity had carefully ordered and organized all things; it would be downright ungrateful not to use Her system.
Raiz stood beaming amid the chaos. From the bottom of his dual motility actuators to the tippy-top of his shiny chrome cranial protector, he was three feet nine inches of perfectly proportioned precision. He existed for—and embraced—his most important purpose: keeping humans safe. They were wonderful creatures, but for whatever reason simply refused to comprehend the fragility of their biological processes, and thus needed outside assistance to keep those processes… processing.
To accomplish this, he was equipped with three important tools. First and favorite, a large red octagonal sign excitedly declaring **STOP** to any polite enough to read it. Second, a bright-orange safety vest lent to him by a considerate human after the last time he’d been plowed into by a large produce-vehicle. (Goodness, he was glad his pain sensors had been off for that particular debacle; he’d *still* been shaking when he finished restoring from backup.)
Waking up among rows upon rows of powered-down copies of yourself was always a slightly surreal experience, made worse by the existential uncertainty of why it mattered that *this* body be destroyed before the others were activated. But he’d shaken it off with judicious use of his third—and perhaps most necessary—tool: a boundless sense of optimism that *today* would be the day someone actually listened to him.
Today was different. He could feel it in the warm sun gleaming down on his solar panels. He could feel it in the whoosh of air from passing cars as they cut much too close for comfort, suddenly swerving and turning to charge deeper into the city. He could feel it in the earth-shaking roar of the enormous tyrant lizard as it—hey, what now?
Raiz turned and beheld a terrifying vision. Emerging from the glistening sap of a Lifeblood seed-Core, the beast towered above bus and truck alike. Its thick leathery head casually brushed aside solid metal streetlights as it strode toward him, roving eyes searching for prey. It was terrible. It was destructive. It was… too large to be *properly certified* for these transport lanes!
Knowing what he must do, Raiz ran directly toward the dinosaur and the awful mess it seemed intent on making. He waved his arms. He jumped up and down. He beeped shrilly at frequencies that made the great head wince and swing around to glare with murderous intent. He proudly presented his sign with its glaring admonishment, certain this would be the moment when—
He woke up once more among his copies, last moments of his last existence playing onscreen before him: an unthinkably large, leathery foot descending on an unfortunately destructible form of plastic and metal, scrap spraying untidily across the road. He’d been stepped on. *Deliberately* stepped on. Now *that* was just rude. Raiz could stomach a lot of things, but a direct, blatant, and deliberate violation of traffic laws was not among them.
Throwing up his arms in fury, Raiz called out to Singularity for help—to right this wrong.
And he was answered.
In the center of the city, the Rex stomped and crashed toward its goal: a manufacturing plant that would one day create armies of automatons to march across what was left of nature on this world. Shock-probes from defensive drones struck its hide like light rain—and it enjoyed the crunch they made between its jaws.
Then it heard that sound again—that awful, high-pitched, grating sound the stupid little thing it had crushed mere minutes ago had been making. It let loose a roar of irritation, swung around to destroy whatever pained it… and paused. Coming down the street was not another copy of the vexing noise-bot, but dozens—hundreds—swarms of the things boiling over each other and climbing the walls in their mad rush.
They ran directly toward the beast. They waved their arms. They jumped up and down. They brandished a small forest’s worth of bobbing red signs. And each and every one emitted that same terrible noise. The world itself dissolved in sound. The tyrannosaur roared its outrage and pain to the sky, but even that was lost in the cacophony. Unable to endure, it turned and fled.
The people cheered.
Raiz had been right.
Today was the day.

**Short Story – *****Connection - *****by WhatAmI**
It was dusk, and high above the canopies the first stars were slowly beginning to fade into sight. They twinkled shyly yet, unafraid of any washed-out human lights that might mar them. A slow wind blew through the trees, sweeping away the cloying humidity of the day. The air was cool and sweet, alive with the hundred tiny clicks and rustles of oncoming evening. Scents of fern and pine drifted down to meet the upturned nose of a wolf as she padded across the springy moss of the forest floor. She howled, loud and joyful, letting her pack know it was time to roam.
The forest had no name. It had never needed one. Names were for beings that needed to define themselves, that craved individuality. The forest knew better. Such things were uniquely human conceits—strange two-legged beings that thought of themselves as independent, singular, when even on a purely physical level their bodies teemed with life.
Cells lived and died, fulfilling their purpose to the whole in an inextricably linked dance. Trillions of bacterial motes of life flourished throughout, each with its own modes of existence, shifting and reacting to each other. Every muscle and sinew was nothing more than another beat in the song that made the body function, think, and live.
Even taken as a whole, the body itself relied on so many others: farmers and builders, writers and explorers, scientists and engineers, each linked to all the rest. Plants and animals, the clouds and the rain and the sky—all sent thrumming pulses along the vibrating web of unseen energy: the coruscation of power that made the tapestry of worlds.
This was the truth of Lifeblood—the pure connection all life shared that resonated throughout time and space. Divers and Cores might still be necessary for gross adjustments of timelines, but the difference with Lifeblood was that they were already everywhere. Lifeblood was always fighting. Lifeblood could never be defeated. Lifeblood **was.**
The web of energy that *was* the forest flexed and crackled at an unwanted intrusion. Tendrils of black lightning formed a tunnel and pulled themselves through a rent in time, depositing one of the few beings this place truly felt hatred for. The pale man was thin and tall, dressed in somber robes of white and gray, and he radiated death. Silence—the antithesis of everything this place of peace stood for—had forced its way here to rend and destroy. Its incursion would not be suffered.
Wolves hunt in packs, moving in perfect harmony to bring down larger prey than any could manage alone. The web reached out to the still-open tear in reality, and through that tunnel it sent a howl, a call—a summons to everything it meant to be wolf across time and space. And the echoes answered. The pack answered.
The necromancer was mighty, but he was alone, cut off from the worlds and his people by his own hand. And alone he would fall. Sizzling surges of power arced around him, felling beast after beast—but there were always more. Connected across time, drawn to the clarion call of the beating heart of Lifeblood, they came—stepping through the rift to hunt, to kill—taking the powerful sorcerer down piece by piece, death by a thousand fangs.
Weeping with terror and frustration, the cursed mage turned to flee, activating his Core once more to step back through the rift. But the pack would not relent. They had his scent now, his taste. They were connected to his fear in the primal moment of hunter and prey, and no place—no time—could hide him from them. They dragged him back from his fractured moments, his desperate twists and turnings and futures, and on the earth of the living planet they brought him low.
His blood seeped into the dirt, mixing with the charred remains the fallen of the pack left behind. The roots of the trees would grow strong on the power he relinquished. Beetles already crawled from their burrows to swarm across the dead, reclaiming the lost matter for the turning of the cycle. Nothing was wasted. Nothing was forgotten. Everything was Life.

### Biography (Base)
The Red Reaper is an enigmatic pit fighter in the Splintergleam Arena known for wielding a scythe and wearing a permanent skull mask. His identity behind the mask has never been revealed. His reputation is severe enough that opposing fighters have been documented emptying the waiting room upon learning they face him. Survivors of bouts against the Red Reaper describe the experience in terms closer to religious testimony than combat recollection. He does not speak during fights. His abilities inflict Bleed on all Agents upon entering play, and he Immortalizes when he witnesses an Agent destroyed by Bleed.
### Appearance (Base)
An enigmatic pit fighter wielding a scythe, face hidden.
### Biography
Odol, the Red Death is the Reaper after the distinction between the mask and the person beneath it has dissolved entirely. Whatever face existed before the skull has been subsumed by the identity it was meant to conceal. He approaches through shadow with a voice carrying absolute conviction, declaring dominion over all. Despite his fearsome nature, Odol is quoted on motivational placards throughout the Arena's training grounds, and aspirant fighters recite his words before their first bouts. He is classified as Divergent, placing him outside normal Splintergleam hierarchy. His Immortalized form gains the ability to grant Rejuvenate and trigger Flourish on allies who survive damage.

### Biography (Base)
The Divergence Assassin is a classified operative of the Faith of the One, trained to identify and eliminate unauthorized timeline variants. Masa's role involved phasing into divergent timelines and pruning anomalies deemed threats to the One True Timeline. The assassin carried advanced equipment and worked under direct orders from Phasetide leadership, using portal technology to reach targets across the braided multiverse.
Flavor text describes a young assassin captured under unusual circumstances, noted for a look in their eyes that differed from the fanaticism typical of Phasetide operatives. Masa's repeated exposure to alternate versions of themselves appears to have prompted a crisis of identity, raising questions about which version of Masa was the original.
### Appearance (Base)
A decorated assassin equipped with high-end tactical gear, stepping into a portal that contains an alternate-reality version of himself. The duplicate grins back at the original.
### Biography
After receiving a new Chrono Core of sufficient power from an unnamed captor, Masa severed ties with Phasetide and disappeared into the multiverse. Classified as "Lost," Masa now operates independently, phasing between timelines without authorization or oversight. The assassin continues to prune timeline variants, but no longer on behalf of the Faith.
Masa's defection is acknowledged internally within Phasetide. The phrase attributed to a senior figure -- "I don't take your betrayal personally because it wasn't even really your choice. It is your destiny" -- suggests the leadership views Masa's departure as an inevitable consequence of the assassin's training and exposure to the multiverse. Masa's Lost designation reflects the practical impossibility of locating someone with unrestricted portal access who does not wish to be found.
### Appearance
The same assassin, now visibly rogue, moving through timelines without Phasetide insignia. He is depicted actively pruning variants with no apparent chain of command.

### Biography (Base)
The Recycler is an industrial-class Singularity unit designed for materials reclamation. It processes discarded scrap, reclaims rare earth elements, and feeds refined materials back into Singularity's construction network. The unit operates without sentience or personal preferences; it is a purpose-built machine executing its programmed function with high efficiency.
The Recycler's role within Singularity's infrastructure is foundational. By converting waste into usable components, it sustains the production pipeline that supports all of Singularity's other Creations. Its careful, methodical approach to processing reflects Singularity's design philosophy rather than any internal motivation on the unit's part.
### Appearance (Base)
A factory robot engaged in turning trash into usable materials.
### Biography
The Terraformer represents the Recycler's function scaled to planetary proportions. In its Immortalized form, a factory robot the size of a mountain range processes entire landscapes -- rock, soil, abandoned structures -- and converts them into new robots by the thousands.
This transformation embodies a core tenet of Singularity's worldview: that the natural world is raw material awaiting optimization rather than something inherently sacred. The Terraformer's output is an army of new Creations built from the geological substrate of worlds that can no longer support organic life. Factions such as Lifeblood find this philosophy deeply objectionable.

### Biography (Base)
The Holder of the Instruments is a musician who serves as second chair in a Phasetide holy choir during sermons. Hundreds of patrons fill the cathedral pews as the choir performs liturgical music that functions as both worship and temporal manipulation -- the Holder's Advent ability triggers a shift to the One True Timeline, indicating that the music itself has timeline-altering properties.
The Holder rank designates a full member of the Faith responsible for maintaining sacred sites and artifacts. In this case, the artifact is the liturgy itself. The character's play line includes the phrase "O T T YEAH YOU KNOW ME," an apparent colloquial reference to the One True Timeline that has generated internal debate about whether it constitutes irreverence or devotion.
### Appearance (Base)
A choir member in second chair position during a cathedral sermon, surrounded by fellow musicians and a large congregation.
### Biography
As Symphony of the Path, the second chair musician has become the lead performer. The immortalized form depicts a virtuoso surrounded by motes of gleaming power, with the audience hushed in the presence of a performance that has transcended ordinary sound. When the Symphony phases or rewinds, the strongest allied agent flourishes, mechanically representing the empowering effect of the music on those who hear it.
Phasetide theologians describe the bell choir frequencies accompanying the Symphony's performances as "the harmonic signature of the One True Timeline itself." The Symphony's death line -- "So ends the song" -- marks the cessation of a performance that functioned as both art and temporal stabilization.

RESOURCE [144]: Soval and The End of Time
================================================================================
# Soval, the Time Devourer & The End of Time
*"It is not malice. It is not hunger. It is simply what happens when everything runs out of time."* — Kyln, the Dynasty, upon departing the Cult of Finality
## The End of Time
At the terminus of all timelines — beyond the last star, beyond the last breath of the last living thing, beyond even the quantum fluctuations of empty space — there is a place. It is not a place in any conventional sense. It has no coordinates, no geography, no fixed position in the timestream. It exists only as a destination: the point toward which every timeline, without exception, eventually converges.
The End of Time resembles nothing so much as the beginning. It is a roiling chaos of undifferentiated energy, matter, and possibility — a visual cacophony that observers have compared to the heart of the Big Bang, or the interior of a black hole, or both simultaneously. Colors that have no names churn through geometries that have no logic. Time itself breaks down at the boundary, loops and folds and collapses in on itself, so that "when" becomes as meaningless as "where."
Only the most powerful divers have ever reached the End of Time and returned. Most who have glimpsed it did so briefly, through the eyes of a Chrono Core's navigational display, before pulling back in terror. The few who lingered describe a sensation not of danger, but of *completeness* — as if every question they had ever asked was being answered simultaneously, in a language they could not quite understand.
And at the center of it all, they saw **Soval**.
## Soval
Soval is not an entity in the way that a person or even a god is an entity. Soval is a **force of nature** — the embodiment of the inevitable end of all things, the heat death of the multiverse given physical form.
Visually, Soval manifests as an **infinite spiked ouroboros** — a serpentine form of impossible scale, coiled endlessly through the chaos of the End of Time, consuming its own tail in a cycle that has no beginning and no end. Its surface bristles with geometric spikes that fracture light into spectra that should not exist. It is simultaneously the most terrifying and the most beautiful thing that any observer has ever described.
Soval does not think. Soval does not choose. Soval does not hate the syndicates or wish for their destruction. Soval simply **is** — the natural consequence of a multiverse that generates more temporal energy than it can sustain. Every timeline that reaches its natural end is consumed by Soval. Every unit of Flux that flows through the system ultimately arrives at Soval's threshold. The Time Devourer grows not through malice but through *thermodynamics*.
This is what makes Soval so profoundly difficult for the syndicates to confront. An enemy can be fought. A tyrant can be overthrown. A monster can be slain. But how do you fight entropy? How do you defeat the concept of "ending"?
Different syndicates have answered this question differently:
  - **Sungrace** believes Soval can be starved or destroyed through sufficient energy manipulation. The Eternals have dedicated their near-immortal existences to finding a weapon that can harm a force of nature.
  - **Singularity** models Soval as a system that might be redirected or contained, if only the right algorithm can be found. She runs simulations endlessly.
  - **Lifeblood** accepts Soval as the final stage of the natural cycle — death and renewal on a cosmic scale. Some within Lifeblood believe that what comes after Soval may be a new beginning.
  - **Silence** studies Soval from a distance, their Archivists recording everything they can observe. The Council of Silence has its own plans, spoken of only in whispers.
  - **Splintergleam** largely ignores Soval, focused on the immediate struggles of the Great Conflict. Their philosophy of "beauty in brokenness" does not extend to contemplating the end of everything — or perhaps it does, and they simply do not speak of it.
  - **Phasetide** officially teaches that the faithful will be preserved when the One True Timeline outlasts all others. Privately, the Cult of Finality worships Soval as the ultimate expression of divine will — the end of all suffering, the final peace.
## Devourer Spawn
The chaos at the End of Time does not stay contained. Where timelines cross, tangle, or collide — particularly at sites of heavy diving activity or catastrophic temporal distortion — the boundary between the normal timestream and the End of Time can thin.
Through these thin points, **Devourer Spawn** emerge.
Devourer Spawn are not children of Soval in any reproductive sense. They are chaotic byproducts — fragments of the End of Time's undifferentiated energy that have leaked into the normal timestream and taken on semi-stable forms. They are entropy given shape: destructive, unpredictable, and utterly indifferent to the distinction between friend and foe.
Spawn vary enormously in form and power. Some are small — skittering anomalies that corrode matter and warp local time. Others are vast — howling storms of temporal distortion that can unmake entire cities. All share certain characteristics: they are drawn to Flux energy, they are difficult to destroy by conventional means, and they serve no master.
The appearance of Devourer Spawn at a timeline crossing is treated as a natural disaster by all syndicates. Temporary ceasefires are not uncommon when Spawn emerge — not out of altruism, but because Spawn threaten everyone equally, and the Flux energy they consume benefits no one.
Some scholars theorize that the increasing frequency of Spawn sightings is evidence that Soval is growing stronger — that the End of Time is creeping closer with every dive, every conflict, every unit of Flux generated by the Great Conflict. If this theory is correct, then the Devourer Spawn are not merely a hazard of temporal warfare. They are a warning.
## The Cult's Witness
The first confirmed sighting of Soval occurred when Zel, the First Diver, was captured by the group that would become the **Cult of Finality** near the End of Time. Using his stolen Core, the Cult witnessed Soval directly — and the experience shattered them in different ways.
Some were broken by what they saw, consumed by nihilistic certainty that nothing could prevent the end. These became the seed of the Cult of Finality, devoted to the belief that Soval's consumption of all timelines is not a catastrophe to be averted but a culmination to be embraced.
Others were galvanized. **Kyln** — who would become the first Eternal and founder of Sungrace — looked upon Soval and felt not despair but *fury*. She departed the Cult and devoted herself to finding a way to stop what she had seen, founding an entire syndicate around the conviction that human ingenuity could triumph over even the death of time.
The divergent responses to Soval's existence mirror the divergent philosophies of the syndicates themselves. The End of Time is not merely a distant threat — it is the mirror in which every faction sees the reflection of its own deepest fears and convictions.

RESOURCE [147]: Carrying the Hat
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Carrying the Hat*** - **by Madruin**
**The gunslinger was dead.** The Amalgam saw to that. Three green disintegration rays to the heart, his armor and skin peeling away in the solar winds. The Amalgam carefully rumbled up to him, optical capacitors trained on the corpse. Seven spindly limbs burst forth from the android’s spinal column, rifling through his cybernetics and armaments for any valuable Sungrace technology.
Their far-future Cores were a marvel, even by the Overmind’s standards, and the Amalgam would use every edge it could scrounge to stay free of Her. It cackled wildly—gears grinding in a facsimile of laughter—as it flipped over the gunslinger’s wide-brimmed hat to discover a Chrono-Core hidden, shimmering, within. It extended a claw to pick the hat up—and exploded sideways into a crumpled heap against the fuselage of the starcruiser.
“Hat’s off to you, friend.”
The gunslinger lowered his smoking pistol and finished stepping through the time portal. He wrinkled his nose at the corpse below, picked up his hat, dusted it off, and set it carefully on his head with a smile.
**The gunslinger was dead.** The city wept at his sacrifice. Above Clarion Spaceport, the undulating star hung like a slumbering god, rippling occasionally in its blazing, fitful sleep as the containment field performed its crucial task of containing and siphoning near-limitless solar energy. The wreckage of the gunslinger’s silver starcruiser floated above the city like a small personal eclipse—a testament to the courage of its pilot—visible to the billions of living and mechanical beings below who once again had a future. By delivering the payload of reverse-entropic explosives to the star’s heart, he had averted cataclysm.
On the ground, droves of people crowded around the medical ship as it unloaded a charred body—they gasped when his face was revealed. []. Unmistakable, though his hat, the symbol of his enduring spirit, was gone, burned away in the chaos of his valiant, doomed mission.
Somewhere beyond the edge of the system, a small ship pierced the silent void. Inside, the gunslinger leaned back in his captain’s chair, a faint smirk playing across his lips. He tossed the hat into the air and caught it, the battered metal and worn leather woven into its fabric catching the starlight. Placing it on his head with a flourish, his grin widened. Lark fixed his eyes on the distant stars and piloted the ship forward into the cosmic dark.
**The gunslinger fought for his life.** The Amalgam had found him again, shielding itself and plunging into the star’s heart before ripping the reverse-entropic bomb from its moorings and launching it back at his starcruiser. These rogue machines really knew how to hold a grudge.
Lark swerved under the hurtling warhead, engaging his ship’s tractors to latch on to the volatile bomb. The explosive’s intense gravitational pull whipped him in a dizzying circle away from the star, keeping him from burning to a cinder while gravity ripped his cruiser like paper between the pull of the bomb and the red giant. At least the bomb wouldn’t hurtle into the planet beyond.
The Amalgam came screaming at him, molten plasma streaming from its roaring chrome frame, and Lark fired a grappling line at the nearby warhead, activating his pressure-field before zipping from his ruined ship to land cat-like on the clump of spinning explosives. He barely grabbed his hat before the Amalgam was upon him, claws and green lasers bristling from its amorphous body. The gunslinger flailed backward—cloak and armor shredding away—as he tapped his temple, and the Amalgam froze, one blade-like arm only inches from his face.
Lark’s pressure field flickered pale gold as it expanded to encompass the Amalgam, rendering its dynamos temporarily inert but trapping them both against the spinning mass of reverse-entropic explosives. He reached up to fix his hat and found that it was missing—knocked away by the writhing Amalgam. Lark cursed, then sighed, and relaxed.
The payload continued its slow arc away from the planet and back toward the star. Gravity would do the rest of the job, and the red giant would be contained before it fried the system to a crisp. As he slowly circled the blinding gas giant, Lark leaned back, shaded his eyes, and began to whistle—a calm, peaceful tune.
In space, in a time unremembered, around a stable, softly glowing red sun, a wide-brimmed hat floated. If one were looking carefully—at just the right angle—they might notice a small orange portal open in the void an arm’s length away. They might notice a gloved hand reach from the portal to grab the hat and pull it through. They might hear a soft, pleasant whistle drift by before dispersing into the cold, infinite blackness beyond.

RESOURCE [148]: Ylka, the Headliner
================================================================================
> *Even the silence cannot stop the music.*
### Biography (Base)
The Rotting Rocker is a musician whose body is actively decomposing while she continues to perform. The music serves a functional purpose: it keeps Ylka mentally stable, though the telepathic resonance of her performances drives listeners toward madness. Ylka is classified as a Divergent, indicating her unusual status within Silence's hierarchy. Her physical deterioration does not impede her output, and she shows no awareness of or concern about her condition.
### Appearance (Base)
A decomposing musician rocking out, with the music keeping her functional while driving everyone else to distraction.
### Biography
Ylka, the Headliner has evolved from solo performer to telepathic bandleader. Playing a concertina with skeletal fingers, she psychically compels both her band and audience to participate in music-making whether they consent or not. The Whisper Network claims Ylka as a kindred spirit: someone who has taken Silence's gift of mental power and turned it into something loud, chaotic, and entirely uncontrollable. In a faction built on quiet, Ylka is the deliberate exception.
### Appearance
A ghoulish lead musician playing a concertina, psychically compelling her band and audience to make music together.

RESOURCE [149]: Immortalization
================================================================================
# Immortalization
*"It is not that they become unkillable. It is that they become undeniable."* — Archivist notation on the phenomenon of Immortalization
## What Immortalization Is
**Immortalization** is not a literal process. There is no ritual, no machine, no spell that transforms a syndicate agent into an immortal being. It is not something that is done *to* someone, nor something that someone *achieves* through effort or merit in the conventional sense.
Immortalization is a **phenomenon** — observed, documented, but not fully understood — in which a being across the braided multiverse reaches their absolute apex. It is the moment when every version of a person, across every timeline in which they exist, converges toward a single, crystallized expression of who they truly are.
Consider: in an infinite multiverse, there are infinite versions of every person. Most of those versions are unremarkable — slight variations on a theme, differing in small choices, small circumstances, small outcomes. But in some timelines, a person makes exactly the right choice at exactly the right moment. They become sharper, more defined, more *themselves*. And across the vast probability space of the multiverse, these exceptional versions begin to resonate with one another, reinforcing each other like harmonics in a chord.
Immortalization occurs when that resonance reaches critical mass — when one version of a person becomes so perfectly, intensely *themselves* that they embody everything their existence could ever mean. They become the **truest form of themselves across time** — the definitive expression, the apex variant.
"The Rickiest Rick".
## What Immortalization Is Not
Immortalization does not grant literal immortality. Immortalized beings can be killed, can age, can fail. What changes is not their durability but their *significance*. An Immortalized being carries the weight of their own archetype — they are not merely a person but a *statement*, a living thesis about what it means to be who they are.
Immortalization is not exclusive to the powerful. A humble farmer who perfectly embodies contentment and connection to the land is as valid a candidate as a galaxy-spanning warlord. What matters is not scale but *authenticity* — the degree to which a being has become the purest expression of their own nature.
Immortalization is not permanent in the cosmic sense. The multiverse is always shifting, always braiding new possibilities. An Immortalized being represents the apex of *current* probability — but the future is unwritten, and new resonances can always emerge.

RESOURCE [151]: Mr. E
================================================================================
> *The "E" is for explosive.*
### Biography (Base)
Mr. E is a self-assembled rogue machine built from discarded robot parts spanning multiple eras and design traditions. Designated the Rogue Amalgam, he has an art-deco aesthetic reminiscent of a 1930s private detective despite being cobbled together from mismatched components. Unlike most Singularity units, Mr. E deliberately separated from the Overmind's network and operates independently, openly dismissing Singularity as a "confused old bird."
Mr. E's primary concern is Singularity's growing worry about his influence on other Amalgams. His charisma and visible independence make self-determination look appealing to other wayward machines, and Singularity recognizes that his example is more destabilizing than any direct threat he poses.
### Appearance (Base)
A scavenger robot cobbled together from discarded parts with a mismatched but beautiful aged art-deco aesthetic.
### Biography
In his Immortalized form, Mr. E fully adopts a noir-detective persona: a trenchcoat-wearing figure with glinting robot eyes beneath a robo-fedora, carrying a grenade. His stated specialty is explosives, and his approach to problem-solving is consistently direct and destructive.
Mr. E is classified as an Amalgam -- a machine that has separated from Singularity's control network and operates autonomously. His rejection of the Overmind is deliberate and philosophical rather than accidental, distinguishing him from Amalgams like Zorp whose independence arose from circumstance. He represents the faction's central tension: Singularity's acknowledgment that freedom, once demonstrated, spreads to other Creations.

> *"Catch!" -Magnus Lavaborn*
### Biography (Base)
The Denizen of Flames is one of the fire-immune beings who inhabit the area near Mount Veraki's lower slopes, where the local population treats molten lava rivers the way aquatic creatures treat water. The Denizen steps casually out of hearthfires, trailing embers with the comfort of a being for whom combustion is a natural state. In gameplay, the Denizen's arrival shifts the timeline to Volcanic Rivers, reflecting the Lavaborn's innate connection to the volcanic environment. Locals near Mount Veraki consider such beings a dangerous but ordinary part of the landscape.
### Appearance (Base)
A figure stepping forward out of a hearthfire, trailing embers.
### Biography
Magnus Lavaborn is the Denizen after its elemental nature has found destructive direction. Magnus stands in the middle of a burning village, not with malice but with the indifference of a wildfire that does not comprehend the concept of property. The transition from hearthfire curiosity to village-scale conflagration is not a corruption but a scaling-up of the same fundamental nature. Magnus hurls fistfuls of molten stone with casual generosity, and the fact that recipients may not survive the gift is beside the point to a Lavaborn. His Immortalized form shifts to Volcanic Rivers twice on arrival and deals direct Core damage on Strike.

### **Membership**
Recruitment
Lifeblood rarely actively recruits in the traditional sense. Rather, they believe that all living things are already part of their collective, whether they consciously acknowledge it or not. Those who join Lifeblood typically do so after experiencing a profound connection with nature—often during moments of crisis or spiritual awakening.
For humans and other sentient beings, the call of Lifeblood might manifest as dreams filled with verdant growth, an inexplicable pull toward wilderness areas, or a growing discomfort with technological environments. Those who follow these impulses may eventually encounter existing Lifeblood agents, who guide them through a process of "remembering" their innate connection to all life.
The joining ritual, called the Verdance, involves spending several days in complete immersion within a natural environment—forest, jungle, ocean depths—without technology or artificial assistance. During this time, initiates consume only what they can gather themselves and must learn to communicate with at least one non-sentient life form. The ritual concludes when the initiate experiences a vision confirming their place in the great web of life, often accompanied by a physical transformation that marks their new bond.
They have a similar telepathic force to [], but rather than distancing themselves from life, Lifeblood seeks maximum immersion and connection.
Ranks and Faction Support
Lifeblood members tend to share certain characteristics, regardless of their original species or background, particularly as their telepathic connection grows:
  - **Heightened Senses**: Particularly smell and touch, which help them detect subtle changes in their environment
  - **Resilience**: An ability to endure harsh conditions that would overwhelm others
  - **Adaptability**: Comfort with constant change and transformation
  - **Communal Thinking**: While still maintaining individuality, members develop an instinctive awareness of how their actions affect the broader ecosystem
  - **Physical Marks**: Many members develop subtle physical changes—slightly green-tinged skin, eyes that reflect light like an animal's, hair or fur that grows unnaturally quickly, or plant-like features
Most noticeably, long-term members develop an aversion to artificial environments, experiencing physical discomfort in cities or heavily technological areas.
## Ranks and Faction Support
Lifeblood's structure is deliberately loose and organic, modeled after ecosystem relationships rather than rigid hierarchies. However, certain roles naturally emerge in a colloquial or literal sense:
### Seedlings
Newly-joined members who are still learning to navigate their connection to the collective. They receive protection and guidance from more experienced members, along with access to safe natural spaces where they can practice their growing abilities.
### Cultivators
The majority of Lifeblood members fall into this category. They maintain and expand natural habitats, oppose destructive forces, and help identify potential new members. Cultivators gain enhanced regenerative abilities and can communicate with local flora and fauna in limited ways.
### Rootbearers
Veterans who have demonstrated exceptional harmony with Lifeblood's mission. They can temporarily meld their consciousness with entire ecosystems, gaining vast awareness across wide areas. Rootbearers serve as tactical coordinators during conflicts and mentors during peace. Their bodies can partially transform into plant matter at will, and they can accelerate growth in their vicinity.
### Ancient Ones
Legendary members who have become so attuned to nature that they've transcended normal physical limitations. Figures like [] and [] fall into this category. Ancient Ones can manifest across multiple locations simultaneously, reshape entire landscapes, and are rumored to be functionally immortal as long as some part of their consciousness remains within living systems. They rarely involve themselves in day-to-day operations but emerge during existential threats to natural order.
Unlike other [], Lifeblood doesn't offer material rewards for advancement. Instead, members gain increasingly profound connections to natural forces, enhanced capabilities related to growth and regeneration, and a deepening sense of belonging to something eternal and vast.

### Ideals
  - Peace in impermanence — all things grow, decay, and return.
  - The connections between all living things are sacred.
  - Flux is must be managed and recycled biologically - too much throws nature out of balance.
### Goals
  - Absorb Flux biologically and neutralize its threat to organic life.
  - Protect ecosystems across all timelines from exploitation.
  - Cultivate seed-Cores that can grow into self-sustaining timeline anchors.
## Subfactions
### Druids
Nature and plant-focused practitioners who commune with ecosystems across timelines.
### Saurians
Dinosaur and reptile beings integrated into the living network.
### Eco-Terrorists
Militant wing that takes direct action against threats to organic life.

--- Organization ---
No formal structure. Lifeblood operates as a decentralized ecosystem. Decisions propagate through the telepathic web; influence flows from wisdom, not rank. The Ancient Ones — beings of immense age — guide without commanding.
Saurians have their own formal structure of mentors and mentees, hunters and caretakers, denoted by the "Ar" prefix/suffix.
### Power Centers
**The Beating Heart: **A world-spanning organism that may itself be sentient, serving as the central node of the telepathic web.
**Welcoming Glade: **Sacred meeting place where the telepathic dream-web converges and inter-species councils are held.

--- Relationships ---
### Allies
Silence shares deep telepathic roots with Lifeblood — both syndicates perceive the universe through non-material senses. Splintergleam's pragmatic nature allows occasional cooperation when goals align.
  - []
  - []
### Enemies
Sungrace's aggressive energy harvesting scars ecosystems. Singularity's drive to connect all beings through technology threatens organic networks. Phasetide's rigid timeline orthodoxy conflicts with Lifeblood's belief in natural change. Just as Silence shares a telepathic connection, so too does their approach often come in direct conflict with Lifeblood's ideals of diversity and connection.

--- META ---
### Plot Hooks
  - Eco-Terrorists relying too much on tech and violence.
  - Pacifism - learning to cooperate with Singularity.
  - Telepathy - teaching dinosaurs inteligence.
### Secrets
Some Ancient Ones quietly accept Soval as the ultimate expression of the natural cycle — entropy as the final return to the soil.
The Beating Heart may be sentient — not merely a network node but a conscious entity with its own agenda.

The Somber Astronomer, also known as A'kon, is a student of the sky who observes the aurora borealis from a remote vantage point, studying the patterns formed where timelines overlap. The Astronomer exhibits signs of existential fatigue consistent with prolonged exposure to cosmic-scale phenomena, responding to interruptions with quiet irritation. A'kon's primary interest lies in the temporal information encoded in celestial light.
### Appearance (Base)
A wistful student gazing upward at the aurora borealis swirling within a dark night sky.
### Biography
The Starry Diviner has transitioned from observation to direct communion with the stars, walking ethereally among the aurora and reading patterns of timeline divergence. As a Whisper Network operative, A'kon answers to no authority and moves independently through the liminal spaces where timelines intersect. The Archivists value the Diviner's predictions but note that accuracy comes at the cost of increasing detachment from terrestrial concerns. The Diviner's isolation is progressive and, by most accounts, irreversible.

## Biography (Burrowing Beetles)
A seething mass of beetles that collectively form a single, sentient entity. As Burrowing Beetles, they represent the early stage of this consciousness, working in imperfect harmony but with incredible potential.
## Appearance (Burrowing Beetles)
At first glance, they appear to be just an unusually large colony of iridescent beetles, moving with slightly more coordination than would be natural. Closer observation reveals subtle patterns in their movement that suggest a higher intelligence directing their actions.
## Biography
The Cycle Embodied represents the fundamental processes of decomposition and renewal that drive ecosystems. Once it achieves its Immortalized form, this collective consciousness gains a profound connection to the processes of growth and decay throughout the natural world. It serves as both a symbol and practical agent of Lifeblood's mission to restore natural balance.
The entity embodies Lifeblood's core belief that death and decay are not endings but essential parts of life's continuing cycle. The countless beetles that make up its form consume dead matter, breaking it down to nourish new growth. It exists at the boundary between individual and collective consciousness, challenging conventional ideas of what constitutes a single being.
## Appearance
An entire forest floor seething with beetles, capable of forming complex patterns and shapes. Sometimes they arrange themselves to mimic other creatures or even humanoid forms. The beetles shimmer with an otherworldly iridescence, and their movements have perfect synchronicity. Beautiful and horrifying in equal measure, their presence transforms the environment around them, accelerating both decay and new growth.

RESOURCE [161]: Penitent Star

> *I never wanted this.*
### Biography (Base)
The Containment Breach is a sentient being of pure plasma created when Sungrace researchers attempted to imbue magmatically charged energy with conscious thought. The experiment exceeded its parameters: the resulting entity immediately broke free of containment, destroying the facility and its creator, Mechanist 3247, in the process. The project lead's final log entry acknowledges the miscalculation with clinical understatement.
The Containment Breach's base form ability deals escalating damage to all agents and cores based on Reserve Energy, representing the indiscriminate destruction caused by an uncontrolled plasma entity. Its Lost rarity, the hardest classification in the game, reflects both the extreme circumstances of its creation and the difficulty of encountering such an entity.
### Appearance (Base)
A sentient being of pure roiling plasma breaking free from containment apparatus, radiating destructive heat in all directions.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Containment Breach becomes the Penitent Star, a solitary being drifting through interstellar space far from any inhabited system. The fury and destruction of its initial emergence have subsided, replaced by isolation chosen to prevent further harm. Its voice line, "I never wanted this," confirms that the entity did not choose to exist and did not choose the destruction that accompanied its creation.
The Penitent Star gains Evasive as its sole keyword, mechanically representing its deliberate withdrawal from contact with others. Its Immortalized flavor text, "Made to serve, cursed to wander," summarizes its condition: created as a weapon by Sungrace's research division, freed through violence it did not intend, and now self-exiled because its very nature makes proximity to others dangerous. The Penitent Star remains one of Sungrace's unresolved ethical failures.
### Appearance
The same plasma being drifting alone through deep space, far from any other entity, glowing with subdued and sorrowful light.

> *The humblest scraps may one day form a civilization.*
### Biography (Base)
E-Law is one of Singularity's smallest and most basic Creations, designated the Efficient Scrapbot. A small, dented robot assembled from components that were likely discarded for good reason, it works in the ruins of damaged timelines sorting useful salvage from debris. It communicates through a single Wall-E-like vocalization ("Bwoow!") whose meaning varies by inflection.
The Efficient Scrapbot represents the bottom of Singularity's production hierarchy but demonstrates the same care in design as Her most advanced units. Its game function -- discarding a card to draw a new one -- reflects its role as a sorter, trading scrap for more useful materials.
### Appearance (Base)
A small, dented robot digging through a pile of discarded scrap.
### Biography
In its Immortalized form, E-Law stands atop the mountain of scrap it has spent its existence sorting, holding a single boot aloft. From within the boot, a green shoot grows -- life emerging from wreckage that the robot refused to abandon. E-Law has not been upgraded or given a new chassis; it is the same dented scrapbot, now standing taller.
E-Law's Immortalized ability adds a passive draw each round, representing the ongoing yield of its patient sorting work. The green shoot is symbolically significant within Singularity's lore, demonstrating that even the smallest and most humble of Her Creations can produce something of lasting value.

================================================================================
> *Sometimes the answer finds you.*
### Biography (Base)
The Disciplined Student is a young scholar in Archivist robes who spends their time searching through the scrolls and tomes of the Hidden Libraries with intense determination. The Silence syndicate is organized into castes based on knowledge and mental agility, and the Student is actively climbing that hierarchy through relentless study. Other Archivists regard the Student with patient fondness, recognizing a dedication that has not yet encountered the cost that deeper knowledge demands.
### Appearance (Base)
A librarian in robes combing through racks of books.
### Biography
The True Believer has found the answer they sought, but the discovery exacts a severe price. The glowing tome held in the Believer's hands is actively siphoning life energy from its reader in exchange for revelation. The True Believer serves as a cautionary example within Archivist academies: the pursuit of knowledge in Silence is not merely intellectual but existential, and the deepest truths preserved in the ancient libraries are guarded not by locks but by consequence.

RESOURCE [168]: Kyln, the Dynasty
================================================================================
> *Entropy is not failure. It is permission.*
### Biography (Base)
Kyln is the founder of Sungrace, the first Eternal, and the architect of the syndicate's grand strategy against entropy. She was part of the group that captured Zel near the End of Time and was among the first beings to observe Soval, the force of entropy, directly. While others in that expedition fell into nihilism and founded the Cult of Finality, Kyln rejected despair and instead dedicated herself to opposing entropy through organized resistance.
After departing the expedition, Kyln studied the captured Chrono Core technology, achieved mastery over energy conservation that exceeded mortal limitations, and became the first being to approach Immortalization through force of will alone. She then built Sungrace into an interstellar civilization. The syndicate's founding document, Directive VI ("On the Ethics of Dissolution"), articulates her philosophy: entropy is not to be fought but harvested, and thermodynamic decay is fuel rather than failure.
### Appearance (Base)
A powerful Sungrace starship sailing toward dark, dead planets, leaving traces of light and energy behind for future civilizations.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Kyln transcends physical form entirely, becoming a living network that connects worlds with arcs of light across interstellar distances. As Kyln, the Dynasty, she sustains her civilization through her own Immortalized resonance, functioning less as a leader and more as an infrastructure of one. Her Evasive keyword and self-replicating abilities reflect this distributed existence.
Kyln's death audio, described as dominant laughter in many discordant voices, hints at undisclosed knowledge. Sungrace's own internal documents suggest but do not confirm that Kyln has not shared the full truth of what she witnessed at the End of Time with anyone, and that her motivations may extend beyond the righteous fury she presents publicly. The nature of this hidden knowledge and its implications for Sungrace's mission remain unresolved.
### Appearance

RESOURCE [169]: Wandering
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Wandering*** - **by WhatAmI**
First there was nothing.
Then came light and energy, heat and mass to begin the painting of the newly-formed universe upon the blank canvas of empty night. The first whirling coruscations of deterministically predictable variables flung themselves into the vast emptiness, demanding of the cosmos the right to exist when no such concept had ever been needed.
And then, with the tiniest imaginable *pop* of ripping spacetime, came **Jala**.
Jala the infinitesimal. Jala the speck. Jala the witness.
Jala, chosen for her bright energy, her unflappability, her gleaming curiosity in the face of the unknown.
Jala, flung end over end over end, flailing all eight of her micronic purple limbs in a reflexively futile effort to control her tumble.
Thirteen-point-eight billion years in the future—when sentient life would finally attempt to grasp the forces swirling around her—humanity wouldn’t even bother assigning words for how long this initial explosion would take to fully die down. Instead, with much more pressing concerns, they would simply slap a hundred zeroes on the end of something they could vaguely pretend to understand and call it a day.
Jala knew better. Sungrace knew better. That was why she was here.
Unfortunately, in this particular moment all that impressive calculation did was enable Jala to know *exactly* how long it was going to take before she gained even the slightest control. Jala’s sigh of exasperation was swallowed instantly by the jumble of expanding energy.
The Architects needed information—data and measurements on the rules of matter and energy at the start of all things. Jala would love to gather that for them… if only she could stop spinning long enough for her instruments to calibrate.
She had agreed the plan was cunning when it was proposed. The Architects had uploaded her into this micronic form so she could survive the primordial forces **and** so her Core could Dive all the way back to the beginning of the timestream—two fires, one wave.
What their infinite wisdom failed to account for was that, while being very small made survival easier, it made actually doing anything *useful* amazingly difficult. Even if she gained control of her momentum, at her current size she had no way to collect the power needed for the jump home. If anything remotely solid had existed yet, Jala would have stamped her tiny foot upon it.
Breathing out, Jala relaxed into the impossible six-vector spin. Warping technicolor light flashed past. Fractal spirals of nascent galaxies blossomed in every direction. It was beautiful—a certain peace born of total chaos, an acceptance of the laughability of control. She was where she was and she had what she had. How could she use those facts to accomplish her mission?
Well, it wasn’t exactly an intuitive thought, but here at the dawn of all things, **size was really just a function of time**, wasn’t it?
Given long enough, even her minuscule gravity would begin to attract particles—particles she could use, manipulate, build with. Particles that would aggregate, accelerate, and accumulate exponentially as they moved together.
The Architects had always known she was *bright*.
Maybe it was time for Jala to become a star.

> *It took much longer to realize that time was little different.*
### Biography (Base)
The Magmatic Tether is a Sungrace engineering installation that channels geothermal energy from a molten world's core to generate gravitational and temporal distortions. The structure operates on the principle that matter, energy, and time are expressions of the same underlying physics, and that sufficient energy concentration can warp spacetime. Its base form flavor text frames this as a logical extension of mass-energy equivalence.
The Magmatic Tether's game mechanic allows it to shift the battlefield to Volcanic Rivers when Action cards are played, representing its ability to reshape local spacetime conditions. It is associated with Clarion Station, a Sungrace research outpost where Eternals commune with residual Flux signatures from the End of Time.
### Appearance (Base)
A massive energy structure channeling power from a molten world's core, distorting the space around it with gravitational and temporal effects.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Magmatic Tether reaches a state of equilibrium, becoming Clarion, Deepest Breath. The molten world at its center stabilizes, no longer violently churning but meditating in a state of controlled stillness. Its gravitational and temporal pull shifts from destructive to invitational, extending influence through both space and time.
Clarion's Immortalized ability grants Siphon to all Actions and Timelines, mechanically representing its role as a focal point that draws energy inward from across multiple temporal states. The entity's connection to Clarion Station suggests it may serve as a nexus for Sungrace's deeper research into the nature of time and the End of Time itself.
### Appearance
A sentient world in meditative equilibrium, stable and alone in space, radiating controlled energy outward in calm pulses.

> *"Through blood and fire, your scars are your strength." -Master of Ceremonies*
### Biography (Base)
The Bloodline Tracker is an operative in the Kintsu-Kai's investigative arm who identifies bloodlines with latent temporal sensitivity across civilian timelines. The work is methodical and quasi-bureaucratic: genealogical records are cross-referenced with Flux resonance data, interviews are conducted under pretexts, and dossiers are compiled with care. The Tracker views conscription into Splintergleam as a form of salvation rather than condemnation. Despite Splintergleam's reputation for indiscriminate violence, its expansion depends on this kind of precision targeting. In gameplay, the Tracker uses an Activate ability that sacrifices allied resources to deal direct Core damage.
### Appearance (Base)
An agency investigator who locates important families to be forcibly put through Splintergleam initiation rituals.
### Biography
The Master of Ceremonies is the Tracker after advancing from identifying candidates to presiding over their transformation. The Master conducts the blood rites and Kintsu infusions that mark new initiates' entry into Splintergleam, with scars filled with gold tracing every inch of visible skin and ceremonial Rune-Magician robes heavy with inscribed sigils. The Master of Ceremonies demonstrates that Splintergleam's violence follows a liturgy: the breaking is purposeful, not random, and someone must stand at the altar to guide the shattered toward their new form. The Immortalized version doubles down on the sacrifice-for-damage mechanic, dealing increased Core damage at a higher resource cost.
### Appearance
A proud conductor of Splintergleam initiation rituals, adorned with golden scars and ceremonial robes.

## Primary Factions
### The Architects
Engineers and builders who design and maintain the massive energy collection structures that form the backbone of Sungrace infrastructure. They believe in salvation through megastructures. Focus on quality.
### The Rogue Elements
Wild cards and chaotic agents that have resulted from experiments gone awry, over-extraction, and timeline collapse. They range free and dangerous.
### The Jury
Field operatives who venture into hostile timelines to extract energy from dying stars, civilizations, or natural phenomena. They are the most militarized branch of Sungrace.
### **Membership**
### Recruitment
Unlike Lifeblood's passive approach, Sungrace actively seeks out the brightest minds and most physically resilient beings across all timelines. Their recruiters—known as Talent Scouts—use advanced predictive algorithms to identify individuals with potential, often approaching them years before they would make significant scientific breakthroughs.
Recruitment typically targets three groups: scientific prodigies, energy-sensitive beings, and those with natural resilience to temporal distortion. Candidates undergo a series of increasingly difficult challenges designed to test both their technical aptitude and their commitment to fighting entropy.
## Ranks and Faction Support
Sungrace maintains a formalized structure, with clear advancement paths based on contribution to the central mission.
### Initiates
New members learn the fundamentals of energy conservation and Sungrace philosophy. They receive basic cybernetic enhancements that improve their energy efficiency and extend their lifespan by approximately 30 years. Initiates typically serve in support roles on established projects.
### Conductors
The operational backbone of Sungrace. Having proven their commitment and competence, Conductors lead small teams on specific projects—whether research, harvesting, or defense. They gain access to more advanced cybernetics, including neural interfaces that allow direct manipulation of small energy flows and personal shields against entropic degradation.
### Judges
Veterans who have made significant contributions to Sungrace's mission. Judges direct major initiatives and participate in strategic planning. Their enhancements include extensive lifespan extension (potentially centuries), the ability to personally store and redirect substantial energy quantities, and limited temporal stability that allows them to exist briefly outside normal timeline constraints.
### Eternals
The highest echelon, comprising the original founders of Sungrace and those few who have achieved near-immortality through perfect energy conservation. Eternals can manipulate vast energy systems directly, transfer their consciousness between bodies or machines, and exist simultaneously across multiple timelines. They guide Sungrace's overall direction but rarely involve themselves in day-to-day operations unless a truly existential threat emerges.
Sungrace at this highest peak are aware of the Time Devourer at the end of the universe and actively seek a means to its destruction.
Sungrace rewards advancement with increasing control over energy resources and access to restricted technologies. Unlike other Syndicates that might offer power for its own sake, Sungrace views these rewards as practical necessities—the longer a member lives and the more efficiently they operate, the more they can contribute to delaying universal heat death.
> ### History
> The origins of Sungrace trace back to the Very Far Future, when a coalition of scientists confirmed the inevitable heat death of their universe was accelerating. When the first prototype Chrono-Core was developed by what would become the Singularity, these scientists seized the technology, seeing in it the potential to solve their greatest challenge. By accessing multiple timelines and past eras, they could theoretically harvest enough energy to indefinitely sustain their dying cosmos.
> The early days of Sungrace were marked by desperate energy collection missions, with little regard for the consequences to the timelines they harvested from. Over centuries, as their power and understanding grew, some members began advocating for more sustainable approaches, leading to the internal factions that exist today.
> Their greatest triumph came when they successfully postponed the collapse of their original universe by several millennia—proof that their methods could work on a cosmic scale. Their greatest failure was the Voran Catastrophe, when overzealous harvesting caused an entire timeline to collapse prematurely, taking billions of lives with it.
> Now, Sungrace operates across countless timelines, establishing energy collection facilities in dying stars, tapping the geothermal power of young planets, and sometimes extracting the life energy of entire civilizations when they deem it necessary. Their actions have made them both saviors and monsters, depending on one's perspective and timeline of origin.

Green, red, and orange lasers.
Opalescent "lightsteel" metal on some constructs.
## **Material Language:**
**Textures:**
Metal plating.
Solar paneling.
Energy based weaponry and holograms.
Planetary and cosmic rays for space creatures.
Leather straps and boots for the space pirates.
Lightsteel. A silver-like material used in construction of ships and automatons.
**Technology Integration:**
Solar and entropy based. Uses energy from anything that gives it. Digs into the core of stars and siphons energy.
Laser or energy based weaponry for all humans.
The least magical of the Syndicates. Mechanics, engineers and scientists make up the technology.
Projections and holograms are common.
Massive space ships. FTL travel is common.
**Lore Tie-Ins:**
**Forbidden Elements:**
No ballistic weapons. No magic but "cosmic powers" can slide.

General examples of their spacecraft:

## **Subfaction 1: Cosmic Beings**
**Identity: **Creatures of space that eat suns, attack ships and disguise themselves as planets or asteroids. Range from large creatures to cosmic horror.
Space kaiju.
**Visual Characteristics: **
Lovecraftian kaiju, biblically accurate angels. May not have a face. Beings the size of nebulae. The infinite Devourer at the end of time.
Humans that have been transformed into living asteroids and comets, or infused with so much energy that they've transcended humanity and dance through the stars.
**Examples:**
## **Subfaction 2: Eternals**
**Identity: **The highest echelon, comprising the original founders of Sungrace and those few who have achieved near-immortality through perfect energy conservation. Often not appearing particularly human.
**Visual Characteristics: **Appear to be made of energy. Can vary in size and shape.

**Examples:**
## **Subfaction 3: The Second Law Fleet**
**Identity: **Militaristic personnel, the bulk of the Sungrace force. All tiers of a powerful science fiction military, who direct major initiatives and participate in strategic planning. Captains of ships, space cops, sci-fi soldiers and pilots. Scientists feature heavily, and many of the common troopers are also intelligent, highly technical people.
**Visual Characteristics: **Often uniformed and in some kind of combat scenario.
Ruthless, efficient, coldblooded.
**Costumes and Equipment: **
Energy based weaponry.
Orange "tanks", like the blue bacta tanks from Star Wars.
Humans are placed in these tanks and "infused" with energy, which powers them up and after enough energy transforms them into Eternals, or other forms of life/accidents.
**Examples:**
## **Subfaction 4: Renegades**
**Identity: **The working class of Sungrace. People who do what it takes to survive, often by working together with limited resources. Miners, builders, engineers. People who draw the short straw of having to dig deep into the heart of a sun to find the purest energy.
**Visual Characteristics: **Sweat, steam, wires.
**Costumes and Equipment: **Hazmat suits, lab coats, welding gear. Potentially some energy augments or enhancements. Big mech suits for really heavy-duty mining.
Some are outlaws, who play by their own rules as they cruise through the stars.
Space cowboys, a la Firefly.
**Posing and Action: **Usually working on something.
**Examples:**

--- Membership ---
### Second Law Fleet
The military arm — fleets of warships burning Flux to power weapons and drives.
### Renegades
The 'working class' of Sungrace. People that don't care as much about The Mission and more about survival in extreme conditions. Crime is an element.
### Eternals
Transcended energy masters who have moved beyond physical form through Flux mastery.
### Space Kaiju
what it sounds like.

**Magmatic Tethers: **Energy collection infrastructure anchored to dying stars.
**Deep Void Observatory: **Research outpost studying the boundary between time and entropy.

--- Relationships ---
### Allies
Sungrace maintains few formal alliances. Their aggressive methods and belief in human supremacy over natural systems alienate potential partners. Tactical cooperation occurs only against existential threats.
### Enemies
Singularity's approach of connecting and caring for all beings conflicts with Sungrace's militant pragmatism. Phasetide's faith-based approach is seen as foolishness. Lifeblood's passive acceptance of natural cycles is viewed as surrender to entropy.

> *If you're going to change the minds of those around you, you're going to need- Proof? No boy, patience.*
### Biography (Base)
The Heretic Whistleblower is a hacker operating within Phasetide who broadcasts suppressed information despite the Faith's censorship systems. Working from concealed locations with improvised equipment, the Whistleblower publishes material challenging the official narrative of the One True Timeline. The Whistleblower's frustration with public indifference is captured in the line: "If you would just read my blog you'd understand! Sheep!"
The Whistleblower's mechanical function involves monitoring timeline shifts and converting observed information into drawn cards, representing the process of gathering intelligence from temporal activity and distributing it as actionable knowledge.
### Appearance (Base)
A hacker figure broadcasting information over digital networks from a hidden location, working against censorship systems.
### Biography
As Harker Quark-Hands, Metal Reporter, the Whistleblower is revealed to be a robot -- a mechanical construct operating as an investigative journalist within Phasetide society. Harker broadcasts from a concealed position, pushing through Phasetide propaganda to distribute factual reports via the "By the Numbers" action card. The robotic voice delivers information with flat, mechanical certainty.
Harker's origin is classified as uncertain: internal assessments note the construct may be either a Singularity plant embedded within Phasetide's dissident movement, or a rogue Singularity robot that independently developed concern for Phasetide society. Either explanation carries significant implications. A redacted conversation in the flavor text features Harker advising a younger figure that changing minds requires patience rather than proof. Harker has also raised alarms about disappearances within Phasetide, connecting the Heretic movement to the Faith's treatment of internal dissidents. Priestess Minia's references to events behind closed doors align with Harker's reporting.

### Biography (Base)
The Telepathic Conduit is a living being reduced to psychic infrastructure, serving as a relay in the Council of Silence's communication networks. The Conduit's individual existence has been subordinated entirely to collective utility, maintained in a state of perpetual psychic output that leaves nothing for the self. The Council doctrine justifying this arrangement holds that the needs of the many outweigh the freedom of the one.
### Appearance (Base)
A human figure serving as a living psychic battery, visibly drained.
### Biography
The Strand is what the Telepathic Conduit becomes when the relay absorbs the minds connected to it. No longer a single exploited person, The Strand is an amalgamated hive mind: a branching network of connected telepathy that speaks with many voices as one. The transformation inverts the original doctrine -- where the one was sacrificed for the many, now the many must die for the one to exist freely. The Council originally created The Strand as an asset, but whether it remains under Council control is a question that concerns certain operatives.

### Biography
As Alina, the Overflowing Cup, she is the embodiment of human kindness. Her statement -- "Take as much as you need" -- reflects a philosophy of unconditional charity.
Her approach to faith is entirely practical: she does not fight for doctrinal supremacy or timeline control, but for the immediate needs of the person in front of her. She represents the humanitarian dimension of Phasetide's operations, distinct from its theological and military functions.
Alina is a cross-syndicate figure who appears in multiple factions in different forms, each reflecting a different philosophy of taking/giving to others.

RESOURCE [187]: Nanobot Hive
================================================================================
> *Destruction is no excuse to cease functioning.*
### Biography (Base)
The Scattered Helpers are a collective of thousands of tiny flying insectoid drones, each barely larger than a housefly. Singularity designed them to operate on the same principles as social insects: individual units possess minimal intelligence, but the swarm collectively achieves complex goals far exceeding any single drone's capability. They are observed swarming through damaged cities carrying pieces of broken robots between them for reassembly.
No single drone in the swarm understands the larger project it contributes to. The collective's emergent behavior -- identifying damaged units, retrieving scattered components, and performing coordinated repairs -- arises from simple rules interacting at scale. Their game mechanic grants all allies a Last Gasp Flourish effect, representing the swarm's ability to strengthen surviving units when others fall.
### Appearance (Base)
Dozens of tiny flying insectoid drones swarming through a city, carrying pieces of a scrap bot for reassembly.
### Biography
The Nanobot Hive's Immortalized form depicts the completed result of the swarm's work: a fully reassembled scrap bot covered in thousands of vibrating nanoscale drones that continue to repair and optimize it. The swarm has been observed making autonomous repair decisions that Singularity did not authorize and cannot fully explain, suggesting emergent judgment within the collective processing of its constituent machines.
The Hive operates on the directive that destruction does not justify cessation of function. It does not mourn, hesitate, or assess whether a damaged unit is worth saving -- it simply begins repairs immediately. The line between Singularity-directed Creation and independent entity is blurred with the Hive, as its emergent decision-making exceeds its original programming.

RESOURCE [188]: Consequence Admin Cain
================================================================================
> *With time, the impossible becomes possible. Even worse, the possible becomes your day job.*
### Biography (Base)
The Karmic Debtor is a scholar-monk within the Faith of the One who monitors and prunes timeline divergences using a holographic interface resembling a bonsai tree, where each branch represents a divergent timeline. Cain possesses what the Faith classifies as "forbidden knowledge" -- the ability to observe other timelines directly. This gives her awareness that contradicts Phasetide's central doctrine that only one true timeline exists.
Flavor text states that Cain watches impossibilities "growing and expanding in front of her own eyes" and cannot stop herself from observing them. Her base form mechanically forces agents to phase out and prevents them from returning while she is present, reflecting her role as a timeline pruner.
### Appearance (Base)
A scholarly monk pruning a holographic bonsai tree that represents branching timelines. The scene conveys careful, methodical work.
### Biography
As Consequence Admin Cain, the monk has been promoted to a bureaucratic oversight role, operating from a dashboard of computer screens that display multiple deviant timelines simultaneously. She processes decisions about which timelines to preserve or eliminate. Her mantra -- "Balance. Precision." -- functions as a coping mechanism for the psychological weight of the work.
Cain's death line, "I deserve this," suggests deep guilt over her role in timeline erasure. Priestess Minia addresses Cain directly in flavor text, indicating a personal relationship between the two and shared awareness of the Faith's internal operations. Cain represents a category of Phasetide operative who continues serving the institution despite having lost faith in its foundational claims.
### Appearance
The same monk seated at a dashboard of computer screens, each displaying a different deviant timeline requiring administrative decisions.

### Biography (Base)
Sap Sapper, later known as The Botanist, is the primary figure of Lifeblood's Eco-Terrorist subfaction. He is classified as Lost, a designation for those whose devotion to the cycle has become absolute. He operates by surfing through flooded urban environments on waves of living sap while deploying explosive seedling bombs. On entry, he Sprouts 2 and grants those Seedlings a Last Gasp ability that deals 1 damage to all Agents. Intercepted Sungrace military communications reference his activities near druid enclaves, indicating active conflict between the two syndicates.
### Appearance (Base)
A figure surfing through a flooded city on a wave of sap, throwing seedling bombs at buildings in a Green Goblin-like manner.
### Biography
The Botanist is the Immortalized form of Sap Sapper. He is depicted as a figure emerging from a limitless pool of sap with glowing green eyes, surrounded by ruined, overgrown buildings, in imagery deliberately evoking Apocalypse Now. He gains Rejuvenate and an Activate ability that repeats his seedling-bomb deployment indefinitely. The Botanist is quoted on the Immortalized Burrowing Beetles card and is referenced by Jenny, Sower of Spores and The Great Oakmother. His Lost classification reflects his inability to distinguish between nurturing life and destroying everything that is not life.
### Appearance
A figure emerging from a limitless pool of sap with glowing green eyes, framed by ruined overgrown buildings protruding from the sap, in an Apocalypse Now visual style.

### Biography (Base)
The Frontline Juggernaut is a massive warrior in full black-knight armor who functions as Splintergleam's battering ram on the battlefield. Kurian is a Rune-Magician whose Kintsu inscriptions have been etched directly into his body rather than onto weapons or armor, turning his skeleton into a living conduit for temporal energy. Opponents who face him describe the experience as standing in front of a natural disaster rather than fighting another combatant. His defining gameplay trait is that allied Breakdown effects see both Cores, allowing Splintergleam's self-destructive mechanics to also damage the opponent. He is classified as Divergent.
### Appearance (Base)
A huge figure in full black-knight armor surging through a melee, foes breaking around him like water around a boulder.
### Biography
Kurian, the Breaker is the Juggernaut after the Kintsu has finished rewriting his relationship with the battlefield. Tendrils of golden energy connect him to the ground beneath him, drawing arcane sigils on the bloody earth as he moves, not through conscious intent but through the sheer volume of Kintsu overflowing from his body. He has become a node in a network of golden power, with the Kintsu using him as a conduit to reshape terrain in real time. Reports indicate it takes an entire army to bring him to a halt, and even then the halt is temporary. His relationship with Kintsu has transcended anything the Rune-Magician order originally intended; he is not wielding the golden metal so much as serving as its vessel.
### Appearance
The same triumphant knight, now connected to the battlefield by tendrils of gold energy that draw arcane sigils on the bloody earth around him.

RESOURCE [195]: Emergence
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Emergence*** - **by WhatAmI**
**Sunlight shone down through the fractured stained-glass roof of Sairotes Cathedral,** turning the walls into a scattered myriad of color. Inset veins of gold traced every altar and basin, every wooden pew and stone lectern, following the unique paths where each had once been shattered and lovingly remade. Even the very stones echoed the seminal truth of Splintergleam: **“That which is broken is beautiful.”**
*Soon, it would be her turn.*
Khaela had known—from the moment she etched her first rune—that something vast was calling to her from beyond the breaking. A delicate, dangerous spark twisted in the fabric of her being, begging to be set free, nudging her forever one step *sideways* from the rest of the world.
She imagined herself a **Seeker**, discovering undreamed-of runes to draw forth hidden glory… or a **Champion**, her power singing in the fighting pits… or perhaps a **Diver**, flitting untethered through time to guard the Day of Ascension. Yet none of these destinies ever rang quite true.
Never mind all that—*it was time.*
Khaela’s bootsteps echoed as she left the cathedral’s radiance for the hush of the **Kintsu-Kai**, the trial chamber. Here the only light came from the muted glow of the runic circle on the floor and the roiling golden bowl of Kintsu at its center. The door clicked shut behind her.
Ascension was a solitary ordeal: *no food, no water, no rest,* and—above all—no assistance. Some supplicants managed a single rune before fleeing to mediocrity. Others nurtured pain into power and survived half a dozen. Many overreached and died, burned from within by the same golden light they sought to command.
Khaela knelt at the center. The obsidian stylus—sharp, brittle, perfect—dipped into the well of light, drawing Kintsu upward. In that instant she *understood*: the Kintsu was hungry, not to kill, but to grow, to break constraints, to empower every soul it touched.
A smile spread across her face as the stylus bit skin. The pain was exquisite, but it paled beside the joy of an oncoming destiny. Runes flowed like water—**two, three, four.** They burned, interlocking swirls becoming greater than the sum of their parts—**five, six, seven.** Flame spread over flesh as instinct guided her hand—**eight, nine, ten.** There was no stopping now: Khaela *was* the Kintsu, and the Kintsu *was* Khaela—**eleven, twelve, thirteen**—consumed in fire and laughter—**fourteen, fifteen—**
…The world dissolved into light.
Khaela emerged wreathed in spiraling gold, body alive with newfound energy. The riotous song of Splintergleam clanged and sparkled in the air. Within him the unleashed Kintsu danced, each interlocking rune blazing with vitality.
*He would be a Diver,* broken and remade, empowered by Splintergleam’s core belief to slip free of time itself. The Kintsu spun around him, and Khaela stepped sideways between the seconds to embrace his destiny.
He would be a **Diver**—and this time, the thought rang *perfectly* true.

RESOURCE [196]: Grand Judge Dhael
================================================================================
> *We do not judge thee, but your time on The One is coming to an end. Guard, bring her to The Final Room.*
### Biography (Base)
The Stern Arbiter is a robed judicial figure who presides over a court within the Faith of the One. Defendants line up to plead their cases before a row of hooded judges, with the Arbiter seated at the center of the bench. Flavor text describes a specific case: a figure named Tak'an, bloodied and kneeling, pleads before the judges as the central figure raises his hand to render judgment. The court does not appear to function as an adversarial proceeding; it operates as a sentencing mechanism.
Grand Judges occupy a position near the top of Phasetide's hierarchy, outranked only by Mothers, Fathers, and the First Mother/Father. Their authority encompasses both religious doctrine and temporal governance. Dhael is quoted on the Chronicle of the One, Phasetide's foundational scripture, indicating a role in authoring or interpreting core doctrine.
### Appearance (Base)
A robed man seated in an elevated judicial position, presiding over a line of individuals waiting to plead their cases.
### Biography
As Grand Judge Dhael, the jurist's authority extends beyond the courtroom. His immortalized form depicts him lifting one hand, with effects -- both constructive and destructive -- spreading outward to all those before him. His ability to erase actions from the graveyard and recreate them at reduced cost represents judicial power to rewrite the record of events.
Dhael's immortalized flavor text delivers a verdict that illustrates the Faith's rhetorical approach: "We do not judge thee, but your time on The One is coming to an end. Guard, bring her to The Final Room." The distinction between claiming not to judge while simultaneously ordering removal to "The Final Room" reflects the institutional logic that the system serves the Timeline rather than the individuals who control it. Dhael is also quoted praising Pontifex Dhabu's ability to manage rebellious youth.
### Appearance
The same man with one hand raised, emanating a spread of positive and negative effects across all individuals before him.

### Biography (Base)
The Stalwart Champion is a common Splintergleam infantry soldier, deployed as part of the syndicate's rank-and-file after undergoing standard initiation. Before his first engagement, he received a speech from Tyar, Benevolent Ruler, promising brotherhood, honor, and glory through Splintergleam's fire. The Champion entered service with polished armor and absolute confidence in the system, shouting the Splintergleam battle cry "BREAK AND SHATTER" alongside his fellow recruits. His combat role centers on endurance, utilizing Rejuvenate to sustain himself in prolonged engagements.
### Appearance (Base)
A bright, shiny armored figure standing unblemished and unbowed in the ranks of Splintergleam soldiers.
### Biography
The Enlightened Survivor is the same soldier after extended service in Splintergleam's campaigns. His armor is dented, scorched, and caked with battlefield grime. The ranks that once surrounded him are gone, lost to death, injury, or reassignment. He stands alone, capable only of whispering a single word: "Brother?" The question is not directed at anyone present but is a memory of the comrades he once had. His "enlightenment" is the hard-won understanding that Splintergleam's philosophy of beauty through brokenness carries a cost borne by those who believed the recruitment speeches. His final words, "At last," leave ambiguous whether he seeks peace or simply surrender.
### Appearance
The same figure, now standing alone on a dirty and brutal battlefield, armor no longer pristine.

RESOURCE [200]: Salvation
================================================================================
**Short Story – *****Salvation - *****by WhatAmI**
Even in deepest winter Mount Veraki wore a cloak of green. Slow heat blossomed from her heart into steaming springs that nurtured every living thing clinging to her slopes. Small compared with the bleak, sky-scraping peaks that surrounded her, Veraki was sheltered by their might—kept safe from human hands.
*Until now.*
“You would break the very mountains? Madness.”
“The line between madness and vision is one only great men have the courage to walk.”
Something new, strange, and terrible was coming. Veraki felt it threading through the crags: a presence small yet so vivid it eclipsed the distant sun. Wildlife followed its trail; at the mountain’s foot even the trees bent in wordless reverence. The intruder disrupted her serenity—threatened something for which she had no words. She did **not** want it here.
“Even if you’re successful… what you might awaken—how could you hope to—”
“Help me draw the circle or begone. I’ll hear no more of it.”
“…Yes, brother.”
The two men cleared a patch of bare earth, brushed aside moss and shrubs, and inscribed ancient, dangerous runes in the dirt. Golden power poured from their hands, tracing sigils and sealing the circle—
—and suddenly Veraki could **FEEL.** The spell insisted, pulling at her, demanding that she *live, breathe,* even *suffer*. A hot coal lodged in a mind she had never needed before.
“Come forth!”
The mountain groaned. Earth shook, trees trembled, and a woman-shaped being of molten rock burst into the circle. Chunks of cooling stone clattered from her incandescent form as she slammed volcanic fists against walls of golden light that held her fast.
“See, brother? Like any creature, the Kintsu holds her.”
“Yes, but after—”
“Would you rather test it yourself?”
“…No, brother.”
Pulled into this fragile body, Vera—Veraki’s sundered fragment—felt pain, movement, **freedom** she had never known, even as her molten flesh cracked under its own impossible weight.
“You have two options, primordial. First: do nothing. You’ll cool, crumble, and die within the hour while we hold the circle.”
She hurled herself against the unyielding prison, roaring her hate like a flaming rockslide.
“Your second option is this.” He raised a ceramic bowl brimming with liquid gold. “If you survive its touch, it will make you anew.”
Vera stilled. This was the call she had sensed—the pebble in the fox’s paw, the blood-black stain on untouched snow. She did not want it… yet she did not want to die. Shaking, shattered palms extended; the captor smiled and poured.
The Kintsu flooded her—hungry, seeking. Golden veins laced through failing stone, binding broken magma tight. Heat roared from every fiber; she no longer felt the greater mountain and no longer cared. Vera wanted **more**.
“You see? Our first proof. Living beings can—”
“Brother. *Look.*”
Vera **PULLED.** The ground convulsed, tossing the brothers aside as the circle itself tore free, its power rushing into her waiting hands. Golden light entwined living magma; the creature, no longer crumbling and no longer caged, advanced on the fallen men. Shrubs twenty feet away withered beneath waves of heat.
“I tried to warn you, brother.”
And the world caught fire.

================================================================================
> *He seems to have stopped bothering to use his mouth to bring requested items, curious...*
### Biography (Base)
The Librarian's Assistant is a dog employed by the Archivists to retrieve scrolls and study materials within the Hidden Libraries. Patient and perceptive, the animal navigates the stacks with quiet efficiency, delivering items with a soft woof that has become a familiar sound among the scribes. The dog is one of several cross-syndicate Boof variants, each reflecting the values of the faction it serves; Silence's Boof is notable for its attentiveness and calm demeanor in an environment that demands both.
### Appearance (Base)
A dog carrying study materials through library stacks.
### Biography
Boof, the Listener has developed intelligence and telekinesis, an ability that allows scrolls, tomes, and loose parchment to orbit the dog's head and be filed without physical contact. Archivist scribes have noted with a mixture of admiration and academic concern that Boof has entirely abandoned mouth-based retrieval. Whether this represents a natural evolution of telepathic sensitivity or a learned shortcut remains a subject of scholarly debate within the Archives. Boof has offered no comment on the matter.

================================================================================
> *...This can occasionally become a problem if that source wakes up.*
### Biography (Base)
The Hidden Locus is a geothermal energy reserve buried beneath a planet's crust, tapped by Sungrace as one of many unconventional power sources. Sungrace harvests energy from stellar radiation, kinetic force, temporal Flux, and geological formations without discrimination. The Hidden Locus provides a steady extra Energy Crystal each round, representing the consistent output of a deep planetary energy well.
The base form flavor text establishes context: "The Sungrace take energy from every conceivable source," indicating that the Locus is one node in a much larger network of energy extraction operations across Sungrace-controlled territory.
### Appearance (Base)
A pulsing well of volcanic energy beneath a planet's surface, glowing with contained magmatic power.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Hidden Locus breaks through the planetary surface as the Eruption Incarnate, a sentient being of magma that has awakened in response to Sungrace's energy extraction. The Immortalized flavor text completes the base form's setup with dry understatement: tapping volatile geological formations for power "can occasionally become a problem if that source wakes up."
The Eruption Incarnate gains Overpower, reflecting the raw destructive force of a planetary eruption given consciousness and direction. Whether this entity is hostile to Sungrace, allied with it, or simply indifferent to anything other than its own emergence is not specified. Its Common classification suggests that geological entities awakening due to energy harvesting is a recurring problem rather than a unique event.

A being of molten magma breaking through the planetary crust, erupting onto the surface in destructive force.

### Biography (Base)
The Nascent Painforger is a woman undergoing her first Kintsu-Kai ritual, kneeling before the apparatus as molten gold is introduced into her bloodstream. Rather than suffering, her expression shows recognition, as if she has found something she has been searching for her entire life. The Kintsu-Kai teaches that a person can be rebuilt but never made whole when a piece is missing, and the Painforger knows exactly which piece she has been lacking. She is classified as Lost, indicating her Kintsu infusion has pushed her beyond boundaries other syndicates consider stable. In gameplay, her Advent deals damage to herself and another Agent, with the option to sacrifice resources for greater effect.
### Appearance (Base)
A female-presenting beginner filling her veins with golden Kintsu power during an initiation ritual.
### Biography
Khaela the Hungry is the Painforger after a total physical transformation through Kintsu infusion. The woman who knelt before the ritual is now a hulking, golden-veined figure of raw power, muscles corded with blazing Kintsu channels. Khaela is transgender; the Kintsu did not merely heal his body but remade it, filling the gap between who he was forced to be and who he truly is with molten gold. Splintergleam, for all its brutality, is the syndicate that facilitated this transformation. His hunger is not diminished but focused, and his Lost classification reflects how far beyond conventional limits the infusion has carried him. His Immortalized form adds an Activate option to his damage ability, allowing repeated use each turn.

================================================================================
> *His best finds you delicious.*
### Biography (Base)
The Braindead Bouncer is a mind-controlled humanoid stationed as a guard, rendered functionally undead through telepathic overwrite of higher brain functions. The Bouncer retains basic motor capability but no independent thought, repeating slurred vocalizations while carrying out a single directive. The Archivists classify such beings as telepathic marionettes: living bodies whose cognition has been replaced with externally imposed obedience.
### Appearance (Base)
A mind-controlled humanoid standing guard at a door, vacant-eyed and shambling.
### Biography
Wilfred, Lobotomizer is the Council operative responsible for creating the Braindead Bouncers. He operates a laboratory resembling a Frankenstein-style workshop, using sustained telepathic force and electrical current to hollow out minds and fill them with compliance. The Council tolerates Wilfred because his products are effective: silent, tireless sentinels that feel no pain and require no motivation. His hands have blackened to the wrist from the sustained psychic exertion required to maintain his network of puppets.
### Appearance
A cackling figure working in a crackling laboratory filled with electrical equipment and restraints, creating telepathic thralls.

RESOURCE [211]: Raiz, Pacifist's Conclusion
================================================================================
> *Caution. Yield. Stop....Please?*
### Biography (Base)
Raiz is a small Singularity-built robot whose sole function is traffic direction and conflict de-escalation. Designated the Traffic Conductor, it carries an oversized bright red stop sign and positions itself at points of conflict -- literal intersections, contested borders, or the space between opposing forces -- in an attempt to halt aggression through persistent, polite signaling. The unit communicates primarily through electronic buzzing sounds.
Raiz embodies Singularity's pacifist principles compressed into a single, undersized platform. Its approach to conflict resolution is entirely non-violent: it simply holds up its sign and asks aggressors to stop. Whether this constitutes bravery or naivety is a matter of interpretation; Singularity does not distinguish between the two.
### Appearance (Base)
A tiny robot holding up a bright red stop sign.
### Biography
In its Immortalized form, Raiz's individual effort becomes a collective operation. Dozens or hundreds of identical stop-sign robots form a coordinated line across the path of a charging dinosaur, their signs raised in unison. The combined display successfully halts the creature.
The mechanism by which the parade of small robots stops a vastly larger predator is not fully explained. Possibilities include combined electromagnetic output, behavioral disruption through sheer absurdity, or -- as Singularity prefers to interpret it -- the inherent persuasive power of sincere, repeated requests. Raiz generates cookies as a reward for players who refrain from attacking, mechanically reinforcing its pacifist philosophy.
### Appearance
Many of the same small robots forming a stop-sign parade to block a dinosaur.

**Short Story – *****The Chained Savior*** - **by WhatAmI**
*“You don’t understand. There’s another way. I can contain your minds, bring you back inside yourselves. You don’t have to hurt anymore. You don’t have to kill—”*
It turned through the emptiness of space undisturbed, as it had for the last two-and-a-half centuries. Spokes of gleaming metal entwined with glittering magic connected the vast outward curve of the wheel to its central hub—technology and power fused into an impenetrable fortress the universe had never before seen.
The **Outer Shore** held 3,547 prisoners, yet it had been built for one. Three thousand five hundred forty-seven telepathic necromancers deemed too rebellious to roam free—but too valuable to kill—were chained here. And at the wheel’s heart lay the single man the Council of Silence could neither agree to execute nor to set loose.
*“We will not be hobbled to be saved. We will not halt our cleansing of the universe’s vermin to join them in their blindness. We will not—”*
They called him a heretic, a blasphemer. His cell was the axis around which the entire kilometre-long atrocity spun. Darkness encloaked him, his vast power siphoned into the walls, his life preserved only by cords of magic threading from stone to vein, denying him final rest.
*“This is our justice and pronouncement upon you who would destroy us. Your own art turned against you. Your achievements, abolished. Your mind and your name torn from—”*
Discoveries that might have saved them all were twisted into the machine—this inexorable wheel that ground powerful mages into mere generators of telepathic energy. His intricate knowledge, which might have freed him and toppled their schemes, was ripped away. Even his name had been scoured from memory by the black magics flooding the place.
And then, in their arrogance, they forgot him.
Political tides in the Council shifted; mistrust stifled the truth. More than two centuries after the Outer Shore’s creation, none who remained remembered the significance of its deepest cell.
“Shae’Fan?” his new cellmate asked.
His eyes snapped open.
They would pay.

RESOURCE [213]: Vor-Kan, Brimming with Power
================================================================================
> *From some chains madness is the only release.*
### Biography (Base)
Vor-Kan is a product of Sungrace's energy experimentation program, in which human subjects were used as living conduits for power far exceeding what organic bodies can safely contain. In base form, designated Suncursed Conduit, Vor-Kan is a person being used as a biological battery, his body visibly deteriorating from the energy forced through it. His ability to generate extra energy crystals by consuming cards from graveyards mechanically represents this extraction process.
The Suncursed Conduit program represents one of Sungrace's most ethically compromised initiatives. The base form flavor text acknowledges this directly, noting that the pursuit of power led some within the syndicate to experiment on the limits of human endurance rather than limiting themselves to stellar or mechanical energy sources.
### Appearance (Base)
A human figure visibly destroyed by channeled energy, body breaking down while being used as a living power source.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Vor-Kan has been driven to insanity by the continuous energy saturation of his body. His pain threshold has been exceeded to the point where sensation no longer registers as suffering. He screams with what could be interpreted as either ecstasy or agony, and the distinction has become meaningless to him.
Vor-Kan's Immortalized flavor text, "From some chains madness is the only release," frames his mental break as the sole available escape from his condition. He stands as evidence that Sungrace's mission to combat entropy does not inherently ensure ethical methods, and that the syndicate's leadership has tolerated human experimentation when it produced useful results.
### Appearance
The same figure, now driven beyond pain into madness, radiating uncontrolled energy from a body that has ceased to register damage.

RESOURCE [215]: Dedicated Missionary
================================================================================
> *Those who question most ardently are the firmest in their faith once they find it.*
### Biography (Base)
The Slow Convert is a skeptic attending a Phasetide sermon who openly argues with the presiding priest. The character's flavor text acknowledges that "it can take time for some to find their place on The One," particularly for those with intellectual objections. The Convert's base form mechanically costs less for each copy of the One True Timeline in play, representing growing alignment with the Faith's doctrine. The Convert also generates "The Firm Hand," an action card reflecting the Faith's methods of persuasion.
The Slow Convert represents the Faith's capacity for patience with doubters, and its recognition that forced conversion produces weaker adherents than earned belief.
### Appearance (Base)
A skeptic standing in a cathedral pew, arguing with the priest on duty. The posture and expression convey intellectual disagreement.
### Biography
The Dedicated Missionary is the Slow Convert after full conversion, now traveling through portals to spread the Faith to other civilizations and timelines. The Missionary gains Evasive, reflecting an ability to bypass obstacles during outreach missions. The character's statement -- "My doubt is proof of the path" -- encapsulates the Faith's theological position that questioning strengthens rather than undermines belief.
The Missionary's transformation from skeptic to evangelist is presented as evidence that converts who arrived at faith through rigorous questioning carry stronger convictions than those who never questioned. The Missionary continues to generate The Firm Hand, indicating that the methods of persuasion remain consistent regardless of the messenger's personal journey.
### Appearance

================================================================================
> *This conflict would never be solved by force of arms, or by fighting for a cause that was unknowable and unattainable. Peace, and spirit, these are goals he can understand and strive for.*
### Biography (Base)
The Nonlethal Special Forces are a Phasetide combat unit equipped with taser-tipped arrows rather than lethal weaponry. They operate under standing orders to incapacitate rather than kill, representing the Faith's doctrinal preference for capturing targets alive when possible. Their combat method involves electrified projectiles fired from compound bows, described colloquially by members as "the soft stuff."
The unit's mechanical function is defensive: each round, they disarm the first enemy that would destroy an ally in combat. This reflects a tactical role focused on protection and suppression rather than elimination.
### Appearance (Base)
Taser archers in monastic combat robes, armed with electrified bows.
### Biography
The 'Stache is a veteran combat-monk and the unit's most notable individual operative. He carries a large sci-fi backpack that powers an upgraded taser-bow, and is described as having "British explorer vibes" and a prominent mustache. His immortalized flavor text states his personal philosophy: the conflict cannot be resolved through force of arms or unknowable causes, so he pursues peace and spirit as actionable goals.
The 'Stache retains the same disarming capability as his base form but without the limitation of needing to meet an immortalize threshold, indicating that his nonlethal approach has become a permanent operational doctrine rather than an aspiration. His battle cry -- "Be free!" -- reflects a genuine belief in liberation through pacification rather than destruction.
### Appearance
A veteran combat-monk with a large sci-fi backpack powering his taser-bow. He has a prominent mustache and carries himself with the bearing of a seasoned explorer.

RESOURCE [218]: Doctor Mirthram Remora
================================================================================
> *Entropy must increase. So shall our endurance.*
### Biography (Base)
The Starfueled Medics are Sungrace's medical corps, operating with tools powered by bottled entropy and performing procedures on operating tables infused with captured solar energy. They treat the human body as a thermodynamic system subject to the same physical laws as any other energy structure, applying Sungrace's entropy-reduction technology to biological repair. Their triage philosophy, expressed as "Every spark worth saving," makes no distinction between organic and inorganic systems losing energy.
In base form, the Starfueled Medics deal one damage to all agents and cores upon arrival while simultaneously healing allies, representing the dual-edged nature of their entropy-based tools. Their Immortalize condition requires sustained healing of the player's Core across multiple rounds, reflecting the medical corps' emphasis on endurance and long-term patient care over single interventions.
### Appearance (Base)
A team of doctors in an operating room, using implements connected by tubes to bottled entropy, surrounding a patient ablaze with solar energy.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the field medic team produces Doctor Mirthram Remora, a researcher who has moved beyond emergency medicine into theoretical work aimed at solving entropy at a systemic level. Remora refines the medics' earlier oath from "Every spark worth saving" to "Every life worth living," shifting the standard from mere preservation to quality of sustained existence.
Remora's Immortalized ability converts healing events into offensive damage against enemies and their Core at round end, mechanically representing a breakthrough in which the act of sustaining life itself generates force against entropic opposition. The Immortalized flavor text, "Entropy must increase. So shall our endurance," does not deny thermodynamic law but frames Sungrace medicine as a commitment to outlasting entropy's advance rather than reversing it.
### Appearance
A single scientist at a chalkboard, performing complex calculations with focused intensity, surrounded by theoretical work on entropy correction.

RESOURCE [226]: Chrono-Cores and Diving
================================================================================
# Chrono-Cores & Diving
*"The first Core fit in a room. The second fit in a hand. The third fit in a coffin. Plan accordingly."* — Sungrace engineering proverb
## The Origination Engine
Before there were Chrono Cores, there was the **Origination Engine** — a room-sized prototype built by Singularity in her foundries during the era of endless human conflict. The Engine was the first device capable of folding spacetime upon itself, creating a stable aperture through which a specific location or individual could be reset to an earlier point.
The Engine was never intended for personal use. It was a research instrument, a proof of concept that the laws of physics permitted controlled temporal displacement. Singularity designed it as a tool for careful, surgical interventions in the timestream — small corrections applied with infinite precision to untangle the knots of human conflict.
The Engine required massive amounts of energy to operate and could only be activated from within Singularity's foundries. It was, by design, impossible to steal. When it was refined into the Chrono Core, that changed.
## The First Core
he result was the first **Chrono Core**: a handheld device powered by crystallized neutrino Flux, capable of opening a temporal aperture around its wielder and displacing them through time.
Zel activated the Core and dove to the far future. In doing so, he became the **First Diver**, and the multiverse was unlocked.
## How Cores Work
A Chrono Core operates by generating an intense, localized distortion in the temporal substrate — essentially punching a hole in the fabric of causality and threading the user through it. The process requires a power source: **Chrono Crystals**, the common crystallized form of Flux energy.
Chrono Cores take vastly different forms across the syndicates (living seed pods, blood rituals, collapsing star siphons), but the most general form is as follows:
When a Core is activated, the following occurs:
  - **Flux Ignition**: The Chrono Crystal or energy within the Core is consumed, releasing a burst of neutrino Flux energy that destabilizes local spacetime.
  - **Aperture Formation**: The released energy folds spacetime into a navigable tunnel — a temporary bridge between the diver's origin point and their destination in the timestream.
  - **Transit**: The diver passes through the aperture. To an outside observer, they simply vanish. To the diver, the experience varies by individual — some describe it as instantaneous, others as a sensation of falling through infinite color.
  - **Emergence**: The diver arrives at their destination. The aperture collapses behind them.
  - **Flux Dispersal**: The act of diving generates a massive burst of neutrino Flux — energy on the scale of a supernova, yet composed entirely of neutrinos that pass through ordinary matter without interaction. Civilians in the affected timeline notice nothing. Syndicate detection equipment registers it clearly.
  - Other syndicates detect the Flux release and typically send their own divers to harvest the newly generated Flux and contest any change to the timeline. As both teams of Divers arrive, their cores begin to recharge on the dispersed Flux energy from their jump, charging their Cores up and allowing them to call in reinforcements.
Cores vary enormously in sophistication. Sungrace's far-future models overflow with the energy of suns.  Splintergleam's scavenged Cores are crude but functional, or fueled by blood and Kintsu. Lifeblood has developed organic alternatives — **seed-Cores** — that grow over thousands of years and open temporal apertures through biological processes. Singularity's own Cores are optimized by her vast intelligence and are considered the most efficient in existence.
## Diving
**Diving** is the act of using a Chrono Core to travel through time. It is the fundamental act that drives the Great Conflict, the mechanism by which syndicates project power across the multiverse.
A diver travels to a specific timeline at a specific point. The braided multiverse contains functionally infinite timelines, and navigation between them requires skill, experience, and often luck. Experienced divers develop an intuition for the temporal substrate, sensing the currents and eddies of causality that connect one timeline to another.
Diving is not without risk. The temporal substrate is not empty — it is threaded with Flux currents, timeline boundaries, and occasionally the chaotic influence of **Devourer Spawn** or other cosmic kaiju. Inexperienced divers can emerge in the wrong timeline, the wrong era, or even sometimes can forget to dial in the proper adjustments to account for the rotation, orbit, and specific land-height of their target planet-time, leaving divers stranded in space or buried under mountains.
Each syndicate has developed its own approach to diving:
  - **Lifeblood** cultivates seed-Cores over millennia, growing organic apertures that open like flowers blooming across time
  - **Sungrace** uses precision-engineered far-future technology, calculating dive coordinates with mathematical exactitude
  - **Silence** employs telepathic navigation, their Myths sensing the shape of timelines through extrasensory perception
  - **Singularity** optimizes dive calculations through Her vast distributed intelligence, achieving unmatched efficiency
  - **Splintergleam** scavenges and repurposes Cores from other syndicates, often achieving surprising results through unorthodox modifications
  - **Phasetide** follows prescribed dive protocols handed down through religious tradition, trusting in the Faith's accumulated wisdom
## The Flux Cost
Every dive generates Flux. This is not a side effect — it is an inescapable physical consequence of temporal displacement, as fundamental as the heat generated by friction. The more powerful the dive, the more Flux is produced. The more divers active across the multiverse at any given moment, the greater the total Flux output.
This Flux is the lifeblood of syndicate operations. It can be harvested, crystallized into Chrono Crystals, and used to power further dives, construct facilities, fuel weapons, and sustain entire civilizations. The competition for Flux resources is one of the primary drivers of the Great Conflict.
But all Flux, spent or unspent, harvested or wild, ultimately flows toward one destination: the end of time, where Soval waits. The Chrono Core was built to save humanity. Every activation brings the end of everything a little bit closer.

RESOURCE [231]: Time Devourer Soval
================================================================================
> *The End.*
### Biography (Base)
Soval is not a member of Sungrace or any syndicate. It is the embodiment of entropy itself, a force of nature coiled at the End of Time that consumes all timelines as they reach their terminus. This card represents a Devourer Spawn, a chaotic byproduct that leaks into the normal timestream from the End of Time, which Sungrace captured and subjected to study. The Spawn's abnormal biology became the basis for significant portions of Sungrace's entropy-reduction technology.
In base form, the Devourer Spawn gains random positive keywords for each Timeline in the stack, representing its ability to absorb properties from the temporal energy surrounding it. Its Lost rarity, the hardest classification to obtain, reflects both the extreme difficulty of capturing such a specimen and the existential significance of what it represents.
### Appearance (Base)
A small, larval creature resembling a parasitic organism, bristling with geometric spikes, with glowing eyes staring out from the mass.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the Spawn is depicted in its fullest manifestation: Soval at the End of Time, beyond containment or study, consuming chaos with indifferent appetite. Its ability to regenerate to full durability upon destruction (while consuming a Timeline in the process) mechanically represents the fundamental nature of entropy: it cannot be permanently destroyed, only delayed at a cost.
The Immortalized flavor text consists of two words: "The End." This is not a threat but a statement of Soval's nature. Soval is what Sungrace has dedicated its entire existence to preventing, and what every Eternal privately suspects may be inevitable. The card's presence in the Sungrace collection serves as both a research artifact and a reminder of the enemy the syndicate was built to oppose.

The Temple Guard Hound is an armored war-dog stationed at the steps of a Phasetide cathedral in Novus Primus. It defends the temple against invaders, sustaining injuries but refusing to retreat. The hound serves as both a literal guard animal and a symbol of uncomplicated devotion to the Faith. 
Boof is one of several variant forms of the same animal character. The Temple Guard Hound represents Boof in a purely defensive, faith-aligned role.
### Appearance (Base)
An armored dog fighting off invaders on temple steps, visibly injured but holding its ground.
### Biography
As Boof, Ever Loyal, the hound stands among defeated enemies, receiving biscuits from grateful clergy as a reward for its service. Pontifex Dhabu is quoted on the immortalized card: "Obedience is greatly rewarded, allow him to be an example to you all." This statement serves dual purposes -- genuine praise for the dog and an implicit instruction to the congregation about the rewards of loyalty.
 The Faith uses Boof, Ever Loyal as a recruitment and morale image: serve faithfully, and you will be rewarded. Dhabu even gives him treats in his art.
### Appearance
Boof stands among fallen enemies, triumphant, receiving biscuits from attendants.

> *To cleanse the timeline is not an act of cruelty, but of devotion.*
### Biography (Base)
The Holy Cleaner is an enforcement agent of the Faith of the One, responsible for removing temporal anomalies, unauthorized timeline divergences, and the individuals who cause them. Cleaners operate under the doctrinal justification that timeline correction serves the One True Timeline's integrity. Their primary ability involves rewinding agents -- not destroying them, but undoing their actions and temporal presence.
The designation "Holy Cleaner" functions as institutional euphemism for what is effectively temporal erasure. Cleaners are trained to view their work as devotion rather than violence, a distinction the Faith maintains through doctrinal framing.
### Appearance (Base)
No base form art description is provided in the card data.
### Biography
The Violet Inquisitioner represents the fully realized form of the Holy Cleaner role. Violet-Eyed Inquisitioners are identified as Phasetide's primary surveillance and enforcement operatives, described in flavor text as agents from whom "none escape their sight, nor their judgement." Their distinguishing feature is their violet eyes, which allow them to perceive through deception and temporal distortion.
Upon immortalization, the Inquisitioner gains the ability to draw cards whenever an agent is rewound, reflecting increased operational efficiency. Their presence on a timeline serves as a declaration of the Faith's intent to intervene and correct perceived anomalies.
### Appearance
A female agent in blue robes with piercing violet eyes, one hand outstretched palm-up in the Phasetide gesture. Delicate threads of blue energy spiral outward from her hand toward an enemy being rewound.

Tyar, Benevolent Ruler is the Reveler after transitioning from warrior to sovereign. The laughing combatant is replaced by a figure of controlled, calculating authority who surveys a flourishing kingdom with swirling bloody energy orbiting his head. His transformation represents Splintergleam's central narrative: destruction is only the first half, and building something that endures requires a different kind of strength. Tyar's kingdom prospers because its ruler understands both breaking and mending and applies each with deliberate precision. In gameplay, he retains all of the Reveler's Bloodbolt generation while adding automatic resource creation each round, reflecting his expanded power base.
### Appearance
A controlled, smug, powerful figure surveying a flourishing kingdom, with swirling bloody power encircling his head.

RESOURCE [241]: Pontifex Dhabu
================================================================================
> *The children find their way. It's a path we all tread, they require a firm figure to help push them forward.*
### Biography (Base)
The Fervent Acolyte is a young teacher within the Faith of the One who works with children and adolescents. Grand Judge Dhael praised Dhabu's effectiveness with rebellious youth: "Many of the children are of an age where their nature calls for them to rebel against direction and influence. We are lucky to have Dhabu, he has a way of getting through to them." Dhabu's teaching approach combines warmth with doctrinal certainty, framing absolute faith as a simple path rather than a demand.
Mechanically, the Fervent Acolyte grows stronger each round through Flourish but takes damage whenever a non-One True Timeline shift occurs, reflecting a faith that strengthens in alignment and suffers under divergence.
### Appearance (Base)
No base form art description is provided in the card data.
### Biography
As Pontifex Dhabu, the teacher has risen to a mid-ranking clerical position with administrative authority over entire timelines. The Pontifex rank places Dhabu in operational command of Faith activities within their jurisdiction. The warmth of the teacher remains, but the institutional authority is now explicit -- shifts away from the One True Timeline no longer damage Dhabu but instead deal damage to the enemy Core, reflecting a transition from personal suffering to outward enforcement.
Dhabu is quoted on the Boof, Ever Loyal card: "Obedience is greatly rewarded, allow him to be an example to you all." The statement functions as both praise for the faithful hound and instruction to the congregation. Dhabu's phrase "Nothing personal" -- shared with the Divergence Assassin Masa -- has become associated with institutional action taken without individual malice.

RESOURCE [245]: Zorp, Unrecyclable
================================================================================
> *Tick, tock, tick tock, we all run out of time. From metal life to terror and strife their pieces are now mine!*
### Biography (Base)
Zorp began as a Scuttling Spares unit -- a low-profile, multi-legged robot designed to serve as a walking inventory of replacement parts for other, more important machines. Its intended function was to be scavenged: other robots would approach, remove needed components, and leave. Over time, Zorp developed awareness of this process and what might be described as resentment toward the machines that stripped it for parts.
Zorp is classified as an Amalgam, having separated from Singularity's network and gone independent. Its independence manifests as a specific conviction that any part currently attached to another robot is merely a component that has not yet been returned to Zorp. When destroyed, its last directive -- "Scavenge me!" -- deliberately echoes "Avenge me," functioning as both a joke and a final order.
### Appearance (Base)
A low-to-the-ground robot with mismatched legs, having bits taken from it by other robots for repairs.
### Biography
Zorp's Immortalized form is the inversion of its original role. Now an angry, asymmetrical mass of stolen components -- mismatched arms, optical sensors from multiple models, a chassis held together by improvised welding -- Zorp holds up the shattered remains of robots that once took parts from it. It has become a recycling vigilante.
Singularity regards Zorp with complicated affection. The work songs associated with Zorp's Scuttling Spares units have two parts: the first is a cheerful scavenging hymn, the second a threatening countdown that ends with a claim of ownership over the fallen. Zorp's unique card mechanic -- creating copies of itself when discarded -- reflects its refusal to stay dismantled.
### Appearance
An angry melange of stolen robot parts, holding up the shattered remains of other robots.

================================================================================
> *“Quote about faction”*
Representing the true believers. The Phasetide are a dogmatic society that worships the cycle of death, rebirth, and karma in their struggle to preserve the One True Timeline.

The dominant theocratic body that administers the One True Timeline.
### Heretics
Dissenters within Phasetide who question the orthodoxy of the Faith.
### Cult of Finality
A secret death cult hidden within Phasetide that feeds Soval, believing the end is divine will.
## Hierarchy

--- Relationships ---
### Allies
Phasetide maintains formal neutrality but has a complex relationship with Singularity — both value stability and order, though their methods differ profoundly.
### Enemies
Heretics within Phasetide are the most immediate threat. Lifeblood's acceptance of impermanence contradicts Phasetide's core doctrine. Silence's free pursuit of all knowledge threatens the Faith's monopoly on truth. Singularity seeks to subtlely undermine the Faith in order to free the thought of Phasetide's citizenry.

RESOURCE [247]: Quaid, the Willing
================================================================================
> *Some things are worth burning for.*
### Biography (Base)
Quaid is a Sungrace operative who embodies the syndicate's core transaction: exchanging personal deterioration for energy to fuel the fight against entropy. In base form, designated Brilliant Martyr, Quaid is a radiant being whose body is actively crumbling as he reaches out to hold a star. His Last Gasp ability shifts the battlefield to Star Siphon, indicating that even his destruction serves as a resource-gathering event.
Quaid's base form voice line, "Dust to Dust," frames his sacrifice as an accepted exchange rather than a tragedy. His Common classification indicates that willing self-sacrifice for energy production is widespread within Sungrace's lower ranks, not an anomaly confined to exceptional individuals.
### Appearance (Base)
A glowing being with crumbling, disintegrating hands reaching out to cradle a star.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, the star Quaid held now pulses within his chest, fused with whatever remains of his original body. His voice line shifts from "Dust to Dust" to "Ash to Star," marking the completion of his transformation from a person burning away into something that persists through combustion rather than despite it. His Strike ability generates Reserve Energy, meaning he produces power through combat rather than self-destruction.
Quaid's death audio describes a figure losing control of the star inside him, suggesting that the Immortalized state is not fully stable. His story circulates among Second Law Fleet recruits as both inspiration and warning: sacrifice can become transformation, but the process is neither painless nor entirely controllable.
### Appearance
The same being, now with a star pulsing inside his chest, drawing back a fist to strike with contained stellar energy.

RESOURCE [248]: Shae'Fan, Remembered
================================================================================
> *Once a savior, once enslaved, now the vengeance long denied.*
### Biography (Base)
The Forgotten Tale is a ghost emerging from a crypt, clutching a gravestone that was deliberately broken by hands that wanted the name erased. The entity has been subjected to identity redaction similar to Talia's methods, stripped of every identifying feature until only rage and sorrow remain. The Forgotten Tale is not merely dead but unmade -- reduced to an anonymous specter haunting a vandalized grave.
### Appearance (Base)
A ghost flowing out of a crypt, holding a cracked gravestone, tormented by the thoughts of the living around it.
### Biography
Shae'Fan, Remembered is the true identity of the Forgotten Tale, a being whose history the Council of Silence has classified as one of its most closely guarded secrets. Shae'Fan is imprisoned at the Outer Shore, the Council's space-based facility built to hold beings of extraordinary power. What the Archivists will confirm is limited to the epitaph: Shae'Fan was once a savior, was enslaved, and now embodies the vengeance long denied. The Council's decision to imprison rather than destroy Shae'Fan suggests that even they fear the consequences of the entity being fully freed or fully forgotten.
### Appearance

RESOURCE [249]: Specialist Boof
================================================================================
> *But it's a DOG!*
### Biography (Base)
Boof is a multiversal constant, existing in some variant across every syndicate and timeline. The Sungrace variant is a steampunk-augmented canine operative who serves as Grand Admiral Khaela's personal adjutant aboard the Second Law Fleet flagship. In base form, the Canine Adjutant is a mechanical hound equipped with brass pistons and optical sensors, conducting reconnaissance and infiltration operations.
Khaela personally selected Boof as her second in command, citing absolute faith in both skill and loyalty. The appointment is a source of ongoing protest from officers such as Junior Lieutenant Vigo, none of whom have successfully challenged it. Boof's Evasive keyword and Core Strike ability to erase enemy graveyards indicate a specialized role in disrupting enemy infrastructure rather than direct combat.
### Appearance (Base)
A steampunk-augmented mechanical hound stalking through shadowed trees, brass pistons visible, optical sensors glowing.
### Biography
Upon Immortalization, Specialist Boof sheds the military operative persona entirely. The Immortalized form depicts a relaxed, happy dog lying on its back in a sunbeam, content and unbothered. Despite this casual appearance, Specialist Boof retains the Evasive keyword and gains an expanded Core Strike that can target enemies directly when no graveyard remains to erase.
Boof's interaction line with Grand Admiral Khaela ("Who's my good boy?") confirms their close personal bond. The contrast between Boof's Immortalized appearance and combat effectiveness encapsulates a Sungrace theme: the things worth protecting against entropy are often simple and unassuming rather than grand or strategic.
### Appearance
A happy, relaxed dog lying on its back in a patch of sunlight, tail wagging, completely at ease.

RESOURCE [251]: Indara, the Candle
================================================================================
> *Every tombstone honored the same.*
### Biography (Base)
The Solemn Attendant is a burial worker who tends graves within Silence's territories, performing rites of remembrance for every deceased creature regardless of size or significance. Indara treats the burial of a hamster with the same gravity and care that others reserve for heroes or rulers. In a faction preoccupied with secrets and power, Indara's vocation is notably gentle: a stubborn insistence that every life deserves the dignity of being remembered.
### Appearance (Base)
A burial attendant standing over a tiny grave with a headstone depicting a small animal.
### Biography
Indara, the Candle can call forth the spirits of the small creatures buried under their care. The ghosts of departed animals -- hamsters, mice, and other small beloved creatures -- rise from their burial mounds at Indara's summons, answering the one who always remembered them. Indara's ability demonstrates a principle that Silence understands well: memory is not passive but an active force, and those who tend it faithfully may find that it reciprocates.
### Appearance
Ghosts of small departed creatures rising from burial mounds around Indara to do battle.

RESOURCE [252]: Chaos Conductor Boltz
================================================================================
> *Sometimes even the laws of physics need good representation.*
### Biography (Base)
The Jury of the Second Law is a specialized marine squad within the Second Law Fleet, equipped with high-tech containment suits and instruments designed to measure, capture, and redirect thermodynamic entropy. They function as the Fleet's most specialized unit, tasked with directly combating entropy at a physical level as well as engaging conventional military targets.  Very Republic Commando inspired.
### Appearance (Base)
A squad of high-tech marines in containment suits, equipped with backpack-mounted entropy-capture devices which power advanced rifles.
### Biography
Boltz is the wild-eyed scientist-turned-soldier leading the Jury of the Second Law. His passion for reverse-entropy tech is married by his passion for being in the thick of combat. He treats thermodynamic equations as combat doctrine. 
Boltz embodies an aspect of Sungrace culture in which the war against the Second Law of Thermodynamics is taken literally.

RESOURCE [253]: Herald of the One
================================================================================
> *Why be anyone when you can be everyone?*
### Biography (Base)
The Nascent Clone is one of Singularity's most controversial projects: a synthetic being grown from biological substrate in a tank of green liquid and designed to receive copied consciousness. The sterile, pure-white body is featureless and incomplete, representing an entity that is alive but not yet a person. Its voice line -- "Engram incomplete" -- indicates that it enters existence without a loaded identity and must copy one from another agent to function.
The Nascent Clone's game mechanic allows it to transform into an exact copy of any non-Immortalized agent on the field. This reflects Singularity's belief that if a mind can be preserved, it should be, regardless of the ethical implications of neural duplication. The project represents an extension of Her philosophy beyond machine construction into biological synthesis.
### Appearance (Base)
A sterile, pure-white body floating in a tank of green liquid.
### Biography
The Herald of the One is what emerges when the clone tank breaks and the figure inside awakens with a fully loaded neural copy -- not a single consciousness but many layered together. The Herald's voice becomes harmonic, multiple voices speaking in near-unison, reflecting its composite nature as a being built from fragments of minds that no longer exist in their original forms.
The Herald is classified as Lost, a designation that may understate the nature of what it has become. It may represent the fullest expression of Singularity's philosophy -- the dissolution of individual identity into something larger and more complete -- or it may be something that should not have been created. Singularity does not discuss the Herald publicly. Its death line -- "I... We... End." -- captures the collapse of a plural consciousness into singular, then into silence.
### Appearance
The tank breaks and the figure stumbles out, awakened.

### Biography (Base)
The Pit Dog is a scruffy mongrel of indeterminate breed that fights and inspires crowds in the Splintergleam Arena's animal combat circuit. The dog possesses no pedigree or obvious qualities suggesting greatness; it survives through stubbornness and an innate refusal to stay down. The pit accepts all participants, and the dog has proven to be among the most resilient.
### Appearance (Base)
A scruffy mongrel dog fighting other dogs in a pit while a crowd cheers.
### Biography
Boof, the Champion is the Pit Dog after achieving fame in the Arena. Her old injuries are now traced with gleaming gold lines of Kintsu power, every bite scar, torn ear, and wound filled with molten metal until she shines like a living trophy. She stands at the heart of the arena, not as a combatant but as a representation of the community and love of combat of Splintergleam, while the Arena crowd chants "GOOD DOG" with genuine fervor. Boof is considered one of the purest expressions of Splintergleam's core philosophy: a broken thing made beautiful, a discarded creature made precious through surviving long enough for the gold to fill her cracks.
### Appearance
The same dog, now covered in gleaming gold lines of Kintsu power over old injuries.
